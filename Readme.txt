Software package SASfit for fitting small-angle scattering curves


SASfit has been written for analyzing and plotting small angle scattering data. 
It can calculate integral structural parameters like radius of gyration, scattering invariant, 
Porod constant. Furthermore it can fit size distributions together with several form factors 
including different structure factors. Additionally an algorithm has been implemented, which allows
to simultaneously fit several scattering curves with a common set of (global) parameters. This last
option is especially important in contrast variation experiments or measurements with polarised 
neutrons. The global fit helps to determine fit parameters unambiguously which by analyzing a single
curve would be otherwise strongly correlated. The program has been written to fulfill the needs at 
the small angle neutron scattering facility at PSI (kur.web.psi.ch). The numerical routines have 
been written in C whereas the menu interface has been written in tcl/tk and the plotting routine 
with the extension blt.
