Particles composed of sub-particles where a radius of gyration for
the entire particle, $R_g$, and a radius of gyration for the
sub-particles, $R_s$, are observed. The surface-fractal cut-off
radius of gyration, $R_{sub}$, differs from the high-$Q$ radius of
gyration, $R_s$, in this case. Generally, $R_s = R_{sub}$}

\begin{split}
I_\text{Beaucage}(Q) & \simeq
    G \exp\left(-\frac{Q^2R_g^2}{3}\right) \\
& + B \exp\left(-\frac{Q^2R_{sub}^2}{3}\right)
      \left( \frac{\left[\mathrm{erf}\left(QkR_g/\sqrt{6}\right)\right]^3}{Q}\right)^P  \\

      \left( \frac{\left[\mathrm{erf}\left(Qk_sR_s/\sqrt{6}\right)\right]^3}{Q}\right)^{P_s}
\end{split} \label{eq:UEPL}
\end{align}
The first term in eq.\ \ref{eq:UEPL} describes the large-scale
structure of size $R_g$ composed of small subunits of
size $R_s$, captured in the third term. The second term describes
the mass-fractal regime with two structural limits. The low-$Q$
limit is at $R_g$ and is described by the error function. The
high-$Q$ limit is at $R_{sub}$ and is described by the exponential
pre-factor \cite{beaucage95} . The final two terms are for the
sub-structural mer unit. Using eq.\ \ref{eq:UEPL}, scattering from a
system with multiple-size-scale features is parameterized.
Generally, the high-$Q$ cutoff for the intermediate power law,
$R_{sub}$, is identical to the sub-structural radius of gyration,
$R_s$. The assumption that $R_{sub} = R_s$ should always be true
for typical mass fractals. It should be noted that, although eq.\
\ref{eq:UEPL} appears cumbersome, no new parameters have been
introduced over local fits using exponentials and power laws.

$G$ is the Guinier pre-factor defined above and $B$ is a
pre-factor specific to the type of power-law scattering:
$B$ is defined according to the regime in which the exponent
$P$ falls. Generally, for surface fractals $4 > P > 3$,
for mass fractals $P < 3$ and for diffuse interfaces $P>4$.
For Porod's law, $P=4$
and $B = N_p 2\pi \rho_c^2pS_p$, where $S_p$, is the particulate surface
area. For a Gaussian polymer, $P = 2$, and $B$ is given by
$2G/R_g^2$, through a comparison with the Debye form factor \ref{sect:GaussCoil}
at the high-$Q$ limit as discussed below.
The constant, $k$ in \ref{eq:UEPL}, accounts for
an approximation involved in the description of the low-$Q$
power-law limit \cite{beaucage95}. This is an emical
constant that has a value of 1 for steep power-law decays,
$P > 3$. For weak power-law decays, $k$ deviates slightly
from 1. For polymeric mass fractals of fractal dimension
$d_f$ close to 2 (1.5 to 3), $k$ is emically found to be close
to 1.06. Weak deviations are observed between the scattered
intensity as calculated using \ref{eq:UEPL} and exact
calculations for values of $Q$ between $2\pi/R_g$ and $\pi/R_g$ in
these cases when $k = 1$. These deviations are reduced to
less than 3\% of the calculated intensity using $k= 1.06$.

Equation \ref{eq:UEPL} can be extended to describe an arbitrary
number of interrelated structural levels under the
generally applicable assumption that $R_\text{sub} = R_s$,
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
I_\text{Beaucage}(Q)  \simeq \sum_{i=1}^n & G_i \exp\left(-\frac{Q^2R_{g,i}^2}{3}\right) \\
 + & B_i \exp\left(-\frac{Q^2R_{g,i+1}^2}{3}\right)
      \left( \frac{\left[\mathrm{erf}\left(Qk_iR_{g,i}/\sqrt{6}\right)\right]^3}{Q}\right)^{P_i}
\end{split}
\label{eq:generalizedUEPL}
\end{align}
In \ref{eq:generalizedUEPL}, $i= 1$ refers to the largest-size structural level.
Extensions, such as eq.\ \ref{eq:generalizedUEPL}, can only be justified when data
extend over many decades in $Q$. Eq.\ \ref{eq:generalizedUEPL} introduces no
new parameters over local Guinier and power-law fits.


\hspace{1pt}\\
\underline{Input Parameters for model \texttt{Beaucage2}:}\\
\begin{description}
\item[\texttt{G}] Guinier pre-factor $G_i$
\item[\texttt{B}] pre-factor $B_i$, specific to the type of power-law scattering:
$B_i$ is defined according to the regime in which the exponent $P_i$ falls.
\item[\texttt{R\_i}] large-scale structure $R_{g,i}$
\item[\texttt{R\_i+1}] size $R_{g,i+1}$ of smaller subunits
\item[\texttt{k}] This is an emical constant that has a value of 1 for steep power-law decays,
$P > 3$. For weak power-law decays, $k$ deviates slightly from 1
\item[\texttt{P}] scaling exponent of the power law assigned to the larger structure $R_{g,i}$
\end{description}
\noindent\underline{Note:}
For calculating a summation over $n$ interrelated structural levels one has to use global fitting. For \texttt{R\_i} and \texttt{R\_i+1} one has to define global parameters, let say P1 and P2 in the first scattering contribution. In the second scattering contribution one has to use for \texttt{R\_i} the same global parameter P2 as for \texttt{R\_i+1} in the previous scattering contribution. The global parameters for \texttt{R\_i} in one scattering contribution and the global parameter for \texttt{R\_i+1} in the previous scattering contribution have to be the same. By this an arbitrary number of interrelated structural levels can be calculated.

This form factor calculates the form factor for a flexible

Kholodenko \cite{kholodenko93} presented a new approach using the analogy between Dirac’s fermions
and semi-flexible polymers. The form factor $P_0(Q)$ resulting
from Kholodenko’s approach is designed to reproduce
correctly the rigid-rod limit and the random-coil limit.
Defining $x = 3L/l$ ($L$: contour length, $l$: Kuhn length), it is given by
\begin{align}
P_0(Q,L,l) &= \frac{2}{x} \left[I_{(1)} -\frac{1}{x}I_{(2)}\right]
\label{eq:Kholodenko}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
I_{(n)}(x) &= \int_0^x  f(z) \, z^{n-1} \, dz
\end{align}
together with
\begin{align}
f(z)) &=
\begin{cases} \displaystyle
\frac{1}{E}\frac{\sinh(Ez)}{\sinh(z)} & \text{for} \quad \displaystyle Q \leq \frac{3}{l}\\ \\
\displaystyle
\frac{1}{F}\frac{\sin(Fz)}{\sinh(z)} & \text{for} \quad \displaystyle Q > \frac{3}{l}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
E = \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{lQ}{3}\right)^2} \quad \text{and} \quad F = \sqrt{\left(\frac{lQ}{3}\right)^2-1}
\end{align}

For flexible cylinders with a circular cross section and a uniform scattering
length density the cross section form factor is given by
\begin{align}
P_{cs} = \left(2 \frac{J_1(QR)}{QR}\right)^2
\end{align}
so that the overall form factor is given by
\begin{align}
P(Q,L,l,R) = P_0(Q,L,l)\, P_{cs}(Q,R)

For block copolymers, which form micelles, several form factor have
been implemented \cite{PedersenGerstenberg96,PedersenJApplCryst2000,SvaneborgPedersen2002}
for spherical, ellipsoidal, and cylindrical shapes.
It has been assumed that one unit is forming the core of the
micelles and the other the corona. The core is assumed to have a
homogeneous scattering length density, but may contain some amount
of solvent. For the polymer chains in the corona either a model
where Gaussian chains are attached to the core or a corona model of
semi-flexible interacting self-avoiding chains (only for spherical
core) or a continuous model, where a radial profile of the form
$\Phi(r)\varpropto r^{-\alpha}$ has been assumed. The form factors
have been parameterized such, that the excess scattering of the
corona and the core are consistent with the composition and density
of the two separate block units of the copolymer.

It is assumed that the diblock copolymer consist of a block unit for
which the solvent is poor and a block unit with is good. The
insoluble blocks form a relatively compact core whereas the soluble
blocks form a diffuse corona surrounding the core. The form factor
of a micelle contains four different terms: the self-correlation
term of the core $N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}^2\,P_\text{core}(q)$,
the self-correlation term of the chains
$N_\text{agg}\beta_\text{brush}^2\,P_\text{brush}(q)$, the cross-term
between the core and chains
$2N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}\beta_\text{brush}\,S_\text{brush-core}(q)$,
and the cross term between different chains
$N_\text{agg}(N_\text{agg}-1)\beta_\text{brush}^2\,S_\text{brush-brush}(q)$.
It can be written (Pedersen \& Gerstenberg, 1996)
\begin{align}
I_\text{mic}    &= N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}^2\,P_\text{core}(q) + N_\text{agg}\beta_\text{brush}^2\,P_\text{brush}(q)  \label{eq:micelle}\\
                &+ 2N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}\beta_\text{brush}\,S_\text{brush-core}(q) + N_\text{agg}(N_\text{agg}-1)\beta_\text{brush}^2\,S_\text{brush-brush}(q)\nonumber
\end{align}
$N_\text{agg}$ is the aggregation number of diblock polymers forming
the micelle and $\beta_\text{brush}=V_\text{brush}(\eta_\text{brush}-\eta_\text{solv})$
and $\beta_\text{core}=V_\text{core}(\eta_\text{core}-\eta_\text{solv})$
the excess scattering length of a block in the corona and in the core, respectively.
$V_\text{brush}$ and $V_\text{core}$ are the total volume of a block in the corona
and in the core. $\eta_\text{brush}$ and $\eta_\text{core}$ are the corresponding
scattering length densities and $\eta_\text{solv}$ is the scattering length
density of the surrounding solvent. The functions $P_\text{core}(q)$, $P_\text{brush}(q)$,
$S_\text{brush-core}(q)$, and $S_\text{brush-brush}(q)$ are all 1 for $q=0$. The definitions
of these four functions depend on the shape of the core and are given below.

\vspace{5mm}

\subsubsection{\bf Spherical core:} \label{sect:SphericalMicelles}
\vspace{5mm}
\begin{align}
P_\text{core}(q,R_\text{core}) &= \Phi^2(qR_\text{core}) \\
\Phi(qR) &= 3\frac{\sin(qR)-qR\cos(qR)}{(qR)^3}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
P_\text{brush}(q,R_g)&= 2\frac{\exp(-x)-1+x}{x^2} \text{~with~} x = R_g^2q^2
\end{align}
\begin{align}
S_\text{brush-core}(q,R_\text{core},Rg,d) &= \Phi(qR_\text{core})\psi(qR_g)\frac{\sin(q[R_\text{core}+dR_g])}{q[R_\text{core}+dR_g]} \\
\psi(qRg) &= \frac{1-\exp(-x)}{x} \text{~(form factor amplitude of the chain)} \nonumber
\end{align}
\begin{align}
S_\text{brush-brush}(q,R_\text{core},d,R_g) &= \psi^2(qR_g)\left[\frac{\sin(q[R_\text{core}+dR_g])}{q[R_\text{core}+dR_g]}\right]^2
\end{align}

For micelles with a spherical core a few different parameterizations have been
implemented \texttt{SPHERE+Chains(RW)}, \texttt{SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Rc} and
\texttt{SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Nagg}.
The parameters they all have in common are:
\begin{description}
\item[$V_\text{brush}$] molecular volume the diblock copolymer part forming the corona
\item[$\eta_\text{core}$] scattering length density of the diblock copolymer part forming the core
\item[$\eta_\text{brush}$] scattering length density of the diblock copolymer part forming the corona

$d\sim 1$ for $R_\text{core}\gg R_g$

As otherwise the definitions of the geometry for rod-like micelles are mainly the same
than for cylindrical micelles only the list of input parameters are given here. There is
only one difference in the model \texttt{ROD+Chains(RW)\_Nagg} compared to the
model \texttt{CYL+Chains(RW)\_Nagg} and that is that for rod-like structures always the
grafting density of polymer chains on the surface of the core is used, i.e.
$n_\text{agg}=N_\text{agg}/S$ instead of $N_\text{agg}$. For the model \texttt{ROD+Chains(RW)\_nagg}
this means that the core radius has to be calculated by
$R_\text{core} = 2 n_\text{agg} V_\text{core} / (1-x_\text{solv,core})$

and a corona with decaying density profile .
of the form  $\varphi(r)\varpropto r^{-\alpha}$}~\\

The structure of block copolymer micelles may be described in terms
of the model of starlike polymer as proposed by Daoud and Cotton
\cite{DaoudCotton82}. Starlike polymers consist of a homogeneous,
dense polymer core surrounded by a polymer layer. As a consequence
of the spherical or cylindrical geometry, the density profile
$\phi(r)$ in the polymer layer decreases according to Wijmans \&
Zhulina \cite{Wijmans93} as
\begin{align}
\phi(r)
\begin{cases}
\phi_\text{core}    & \text{for~} r < R_\text{core} \\
\phi_\text{brush} \left(\frac{r}{R_\text{core}}\right)^{-\alpha}
                    & \text{for~} R_\text{core} \leq r \leq R_\text{core}+t \\
 0                  & \text{for~} r > R_\text{core}+t
\end{cases}
\label{eq:R_ma_profile}
\end{align}
with $\alpha =(D-1)(3\nu-1)/(2\nu)$.
$D$ is determined by the dimension of the curvature of the grafted surface
(spherical $D=3$, cylindrical $D=2$, planar $D=1$).
$\nu$ is the Flory exponent, which has characteristic
values as given in Table \ref{FloryExp}.
The corresponding density profile is schematically
shown in Figure \ref{R_ma_profile}. Micelles consist of a well-defined
micellar core with a radius $R_\text{core}$ and a micellar shell or
corona extending to the outer micellar radius $R_m=R_\text{core}+t$,
where $t$ is the thickness of the corona.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For a given radial profile according to eq.\ \ref{eq:R_ma_profile} the form factor of
spherical micelle can be calculated by
\begin{align}
F_\text{SPHERE} &= \int_0^\infty 2\pi r^2 \phi(r) \frac{\sin(qr)}{qr}\,dr
\end{align}
In case of a rod-like micelle the form factor can be separated in two terms
$I(q) = P_H(q)P_\text{cs}(q)$ as already in shown in eq.\ \ref{eq:rodlikeFF}.
The cross-term contribution to the scattering intensity is given by
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
P_\text{cs}(q) &=  F_\text{cs}^2(q) \\
F_\text{cs}(q) &=  \int_0^\infty 2\pi r \phi(r) J_0(q)\,dr
\end{split}
\end{align}
However, as it is more convenient here to formulate the scattering intensity in
terms of excess scattering length of the block units in the core $\beta_\text{core}$
and the corona $\beta_\text{brush}$ like in eq.\ \ref{eq:micelle} the form factor
is split into two parts, the form factor of the homogeneous core $F_\text{core}(q)$ and
the form factor of the corona $F_\text{brush}(q)$. The overall scattering intensity $I(q)$
is than given by
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
I(q) &=   N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}^2 F_\text{core}^2(q)
       + 2 N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}\beta_\text{corona} F_\text{core}(q) F_\text{corona}(q) \\
     & +   N_\text{agg}(N_\text{agg}-1) \beta_\text{corona}^2 F_\text{corona}^2(q)
       +   N_\text{agg} P_\text{brush}(q)
\end{split}
\label{masterR_ma}
\end{align}
The excess scattering length of a block in the corona and in the core, respectively,
$\beta_\text{brush}=V_\text{brush}(\eta_\text{brush}-\eta_\text{solv})$
and $\beta_\text{core}=V_\text{core}(\eta_\text{core}-\eta_\text{solv})$ are
defined in the same way than in eq.\ \ref{eq:micelle}.
$V_\text{brush}$ and $V_\text{core}$ are the total volume of a block in the corona
and in the core. $\eta_\text{brush}$ and $\eta_\text{core}$ are the corresponding
scattering length densities and $\eta_\text{solv}$ is the scattering length
density of the surrounding solvent. $F_\text{core}(q)$ is the form factor of the core and
normalized to 1 for $q=0$. Also the form factor of the corona $F_\text{corona}(q)$ and the
form factor of the local fluctuations in the corona originating from the individual chains
$P_\text{brush}(q)$ are normalized to 1 for $q=0$. Similar to section \ref{Chains(RW)}
models for spherical and rod-like shapes have been implemented which are described in the
following paragraphs.

\subsubsection{\bf spherical core:}

\begin{align}
F_\text{core}(q,R) &= 3\frac{\sin(qR)-qR\cos(qR)}{(qR)^3}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
F_\text{brush}(q,R,t)&= \frac{1}{C_{norm}}
   \int_{R_\text{core}}^{R_\text{core}+t} 2\pi r^2 r^{-\alpha} \frac{\sin(qr)}{qr} \, dr
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
C_{norm} &=
\begin{cases}
\frac{4}{3-\alpha} \pi \left(\left(R_\text{core}+t\right)^{3-\alpha} - R_\text{core}^{3-\alpha}\right)
& \text{for~} \alpha \neq 2 \\
4\pi\ln\left(\frac{R_\text{core}+t}{R_\text{core}}\right)
& \text{for~} \alpha = 2
\end{cases} \nonumber
\end{align}
For the scattering contribution of the individual chains in the corona
$P_\text{brush}$ the scattering function for worm-like chains with excluded
volume and negligible cross-section, contour length $L$ and Kuhn-length $b$
according to section \ref{sect:WormLikeChain} has been implemented.

For micelles with a spherical core a few different parameterizations have been
implemented \texttt{SPHERE+R$\hat{~}$-a}, \texttt{SPHERE+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Rc} and
\texttt{SPHERE+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Nagg}.

\subsubsection{\bf rodlike core:}
\label{sect:ROD+R_ma}~\\
In case of a rod-like micelle the form factor can be separated in two terms $I(q) =
P_H(q)P_\text{cs}(q)$ as already in shown in eq. \ref{eq:rodlikeFF}. The cross-term contribution to the scattering
intensity is given by
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
P_\text{cs}(q) &=  F_\text{cs}^2(q) \\
F_\text{cs}(q) &= \int_0^\infty 2\pi r \phi(r) J_0(qr)\,dr
                = F_\text{cs,core}(q)+F_\text{cs,brush}(q)
\end{split}
\end{align}
The contribution of the homogeneous core is given by
\begin{align}
F_\text{cs,core}(q) = \frac{2 J_1(qR_c)}{qR_c}
\end{align}
and for the corona by
\begin{align}
F_\text{cs,brush}(q) &=\frac{1}{c_\alpha}\int_{R_c}^{R_c+t} 2\pi r \, r^{-\alpha} J_0(qr)\,dr
\end{align}
\begin{align}
c_\alpha &= \int_{R_c}^{R_c+t} 2\pi r \, r^{-\alpha}\,dr \nonumber \\
&= \begin{cases}
2\pi\ln\left(\frac{R_c+t}{R_c}\right)                                   & \text{~for~} \alpha = 2   \\
\frac{2}{2-\alpha} \pi \left((R_c+t)^{2-\alpha}-R_c^{2-\alpha}\right)   & \text{~for~} \alpha \neq 2
\end{cases}
\end{align}

For the scattering contribution of the individual chains in the corona $P_\text{local}$ normally
can be neglected for rod-like micelles in contrast to spherical structures as for structures
with a lower dimension than spheres, this contribution becomes more and more negligible. To account
for the scattering of the individual chains at least in first approximation and without introducing
new parameters a form factor similar to the one of star polymers has been implemented.
\begin{align}
P_\text{local}(q) &=
             \frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{qt}
             \frac{\sin\left(\mu \arctan(q t)\right)}{\left(1+q^2t^2\right)^{\mu/2}} \\
\mu &=\frac{1}{\nu}-1 ,\quad
\alpha = \frac{3\nu-1}{2\nu} \quad
\Leftrightarrow \quad \mu = 2(1-\alpha) \nonumber
\end{align}
The form factor to describe the scattering of the individual chains
is identical to the blob scattering contribution in star-like polymers according to
Dozier (\ref{sect:DozierStar}). The exponential damping length $\xi$ in the definition of the star
polymer has been set to the shell thickness $t$. In the original
paper of Pedersen the $P_\text{local}$ was described by the scattering of a semi-flexible chain with
excluded volume according to section \ref{sect:WormLikeChain}, which however would require to define
two more parameters.

For micelles with a rod-like core a few different parameterizations have been
implemented \texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a}, \texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Rc} and
\texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Nagg}.

The expressions have been derived by Pedersen and Gerstenberg
\cite{PedersenGerstenberg96,PedersenJApplCryst2000}. For a sphere with radius $R$ and total excess scattering
length $\rho_s$ with $N_\text{agg}$ attached chains
\begin{align}
P_{mic}(Q) & = N_\text{agg}^2 \rho_s^2 P_s(Q,R) + N_{agg} \rho_c^2 P_c(Q,R_g) \\
           & + N_\text{agg}(N_{agg}-1)\rho_c^2  S_{cc}(Q)
             + 2N_\text{agg}^2 \rho_s \rho_c S_{sc}(Q) \nonumber
\end{align}
with:
\begin{align}
P_s &= \Phi^2(Q,R) \\
\Phi(Q,R) &= 3 \frac{\sin(QR)-QR\cos(QR)}{(QR)^3} \\
P_c(Q,R_g) &= 2 \frac{\exp(-x)-1+x}{x^2} \\
x &= R_g^2Q^2 \\
\Psi(Q,R_g) &= \frac{1-\exp(-x)}{x} \\
S_\text{cc}(Q) &= \Psi^2(Q, R_g) \left(\frac{\sin(Q(R+d\,\,R_g))}{Q(R+d\,R_g)}\right)^2 \\
S_\text{sc}(Q) &= \Psi(Q, R_g)\Phi(Q R_g)\frac{\sin(Q(R+d\,R_g))}{Q(R+d\,R_g)}
\end{align}
where $R_g$ is the root-mean-square radius of
gyration of a chain. $\rho_c$ is the total excess scattering length of a single chain.
Non-penetrating of the chains into the core region is mimicked by $d\approx 1$ for $R\gg R_g$.

This form factor is the same than for \texttt{SphereWithGaussChains}. It has only been slightly re-parametrised.
Instead of the core radius $R$ and excess scattering lengths $\rho_s$ and $\rho_c$  the
volumes $V_\text{polym,c}$ and $V_\text{polym,sh}$ of the block units building the core and the shell are required
together with the corresponding scattering length densities $\eta_\text{poly,c}$, $\eta_\text{poly,sh}$ and
that one of the solvent $\eta_\text{solv}$. Furthermore $x_\text{solv,c}$ is the amount of solvent in the core which
takes account for a possible swelling of the core. These parameters allow one to calculate the core radius and
excess scattering lengths by
\begin{align}
    R &= \left(\abs{ \frac{N_\text{agg}V_\text{polym,c}}{1-x_\text{solv,c}}} \frac{3}{4\pi}\right)^{1/3}   \\
    \rho_s &= V_\text{polym,c} \left(\eta_\text{poly,c}-\eta_\text{solv} \right) \\
    \rho_c &= V_\text{polym,sh} \left(\eta_\text{poly,sh}-\eta_\text{solv}\right)
\end{align}

The volumes $V_\text{polym,c}$ and $V_\text{polym,sh}$ can be calculated by knowing the molecular weights\footnote{$u=1.660 538 86 \times 10^{-27}$ kg}
of the block units of the polymer in the core $M_\text{polym,c}$ and in the shell $M_\text{polym,sh}$ together
with their bulk mass densities $\rho_\text{polym,c}$ and $\rho_\text{polym,sh}$. The volumes are then
given by
\begin{align}
V_\text{polym,c} = \frac{M_\text{polym,c}}{N_a\, \rho_\text{polym,c}}
\quad \text{ and } \quad
V_\text{polym,sh} = \frac{M_\text{polym,sh}}{N_a\, \rho_\text{polym,sh}}
\end{align}
whereby $N_a$ is Avogadro's constant\footnote{$N_a = 6.022 1415 \times 10^{23} \text{mol}^{-1}$}. The units of the block units
has to be supplied in units corresponding to the scattering vector $Q$, i.e. in nm$^3$ in case $Q$ is given in nm$^{-1}$
or in \AA$^3$ in case $Q$ is given in \AA$^{-1}$.
