\item[2018-xx-xx] \SASfit 0.94.11
    \begin{itemize}
    \item added two additional form factors for ring polymers with excluded volume effects (\texttt{"RingPolymerBZ"}, \texttt{"RingPolymerBMB"}) and renamed the old one from \texttt{"FlexibleRingPolymer"} to \texttt{"RingPolymerCasassa"}
    \item bug fix in ring polymers, daisy-like ring and m-membered twisted ring.
    \item bug fix of \texttt{"GzSphere"}, returns wrong value for z>2R
    \item bug fix of \texttt{"GzgDAB"} for extrapolation to $z\rightarrow 0$
    \item added two more models for $P'(Q)$ of thin cylindrical objects describing wormlike structure: \texttt{"Koyama worm"} and \texttt{"freely joined chain of rods"}
    \item Some form factors for polymers like Gaussian chains, star polymers and ring polymers have been moved to the plug-in area.
    \item As all peak functions are now available as plug-ins the obsolete old code has been deleted
    \item The Lorenz-Mie form factors for static light scattering are now made available as plug-in form factors
    \item \SASfit now tries to avoids starting a new fit or simulation before the previous one is finished
    \item Successfully updated from gsl2.4 to gsl2.5 library.
    \item The new 2D/3D hard sphere structure factors are now available in the structure factor plug-in folder named "Hard Sphere 2D/3D"
    \item update to FFTW 3.3.8 worked after disabling threads however on Windows McAfee had to switched off during configure process.
    \item implemented some thermodynamic self-consistent hard sphere structure factors based on the rational function approximation method
    \item tried to avoid overflow of sinh-function in the model \texttt{"Khodolenko-Worm"}
    \item now between thin objects (local planar and local cylindrical approximation) and anisotropic shapes is distinguished.
    \item new plug-in folder for azimuthal data
    \item new plug-in folder for deformed or sheared objects
    \item new form factors for partly aligned cylinders and ellipsoids following a Maier-Saupe, Onsager, Heaviside, Gauss, or a Boltzmann orientation distribution

\item[2018-03-20] \SASfit 0.94.10
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The form factors \texttt{"EllipsoidalCoreShell"}, \texttt{"Ellipsoid i"}, \texttt{"Ellipsoid ii"}, and \texttt{"triaxEllShell1"} have been disabled and replaced by a series of plug-in functions. Those replacements make use of a faster routine for multidimensional integrals (pcubature). Because of this an optional size distribution became part of the supplied plug-in form factors.

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Moved all peak functions into the plugin area.
        \item Added the possibility to apply after the summation of all scattering contributions a final operator.  At the moment between three operator can be chosen:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item Unit operator which does not do anything with the data
            \item Taking the Hankel transform 2pi*H[I(Q)] for converting SAS model into a projected correlation function G(delta), which defines the SESANS signal

    \item bug fix in plotting error bars of multiple data sets.
    \item implementation of another method for thinning out oversampled data sets. The
        new methods is performing an averaging of data points depending on a
        user-defined maximum allowed q-smearing and a user-defined maximum distance
        in intensity in units of the error bar of the data points, i.e. an averaging is
        only performed, if the intensities look similar with n-times the intensity
        error bars.

              described in Macromolecules 1996, 29, 7602-7612. They have
              been implemented as structure factors
              \texttt{[anistropic obj|P'(Q):local cylindrical geometry]},
              so that it can be combined with different cross-section

        \item bug fix in \texttt{loglogistic} peak
        \item implementation of asymptotic limits for fractals, which require a

              for which an asymptotic solution is available or has been constructed.
        \item reprogrammed \texttt{SquareWell1} structure factor for a squared well potential
        \item replaced \texttt{sasfit\_qromb} function by \texttt{sasfit\_integrate} function in the
              form factor for the torus. The \texttt{sasfit\_qromb} routine did not work for some
              unknown reason. This needs to be checked.

          \item fix for GUI problem with two plugin form factors (contribution updates).
                If there are two plugin model functions with a different number of parameters,
                you can't switch/cycle trough the contributions anymore (Next, Previous).
          \item fix for saving a parameter file (file creation was disabled by accident in previous version)
        \end{itemize}
        \item[8.7.2009] \SASfit 0.91.1: Since the previous version of
                    \SASfit (0.90.1, January 2009) there were a lot of changes to
                    primarily improve the quality and portability of the code. Here is
                    only a short summary of the larger changes done:
        \begin{itemize}

                  as well as plugin development (how to add own model functions)
            \item fixed some bugs in plugin framework
            \item added automatic determination of available plugins at build time
            \item enabled static building for plugins
            \item increasing maximum number of model parameter in GUI
            \item verified build compatibility for MacOS
            \item Extended and improved Scattering Length Density (SLD) Calculator.
                  Now the scattering length density for x-ray energies between 1keV
                  and 24.9 keV can be calculated.
            \item a few new form factor have been included:
                        \texttt{generalized Gaussian coil},
                        \texttt{generalized Gaussian coil 1},
                        \texttt{generalized Gaussian coil 2},
                        \texttt{ellCylShell1},
                        \texttt{ellCylShell2}
        \end{itemize}
    \item[12.01.2009]{\tt SASfit} 0.90.1 : bug-fix in plugin-GUI
    \item[5.01.2009] {\tt SASfit} 0.90:
    new release including full source code and binaries for
    windows and linux. Since the previous version of v (0.87, March 2008)
    there were a lot of changes to primarily improve the quality
    and portability of the code. Here only a short summary of the 'big'
    changes done (as of Dec. 17th, 2008):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Structured the source code into the modules \texttt{sasfit\_common}, \texttt{sasfit\_sd}, \texttt{sasfit\_sq},
                \texttt{sasfit\_ff}, \texttt{sasfit\_core}.
        \item Switched to {\tt CMake} build environment for platform independence. Build and tested {\tt SASfit} on
                Linux and Windows, 32bit as well as 64bit.
        \item Replaced intensive string comparisons for model function selection in each iteration step by more reasonable
                selection of functions pointers at initialization time and direct call of the according function at iteration time.
        \item Fixed a lot of bugs and typos in the GUI (but there are still some)
        \item Added flexible plugin system for external model functions. This way, all model functions can be provided
                as plugins and though move out of the core algorithms. Also enables easy customization. In the future
                the modules \texttt{sasfit\_sd}, \texttt{sasfit\_sq}, \texttt{sasfit\_ff} and \texttt{sasfit\_peaks}
                will be converted to external plugins.
        \item Added \texttt{sasfit\_peaks}, a new class of model functions containing peaks.
        \item Added capability to ship {\tt SASfit} as standalone executable, allows running on system without the
                need of external libraries (e.g. Tcl, BLT, ...)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[4.03.2008] ({\tt SASfit} version 0.87) The last
    modification in the menu navigation still had bugs. Hopefully
    they are removed in this version.
    \item[28.02.2008] ({\tt SASfit} version 0.86)
    The menu navigation has been debugged and optimized.
    Corrected a bug in calculating the polydispersity index (PDI)
    in DLS cumulant analysis (PDI=Gamma2/Gamma1$\hat{~}$2)
    \item[25.01.2008] ({\tt SASfit} version 0.85)
    A bug for the form factors  \texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a*} has
    been corrected. The implementation of the scaling
    approximation, partial structure factors and local monodisperse
    approach has been improved.
    \item[9.01.2008] ({\tt SASfit} version 0.84) Form factor for
    worm-like micelles (\texttt{WORM+Chains(RW), WORM+Chains(RW)\_Rc,
    WORM+Chains(RW)\_Nagg}) and for cluster aggregates
    (\texttt{Mass Fractal (Exp(-x) Cut-Off), Fisher-Burford,
    MassFractExp,MassFractGauss, Mass Fractal (Exp(-x$\hat{~}$a) Cut-Off), DLCAggregation,
    RLCAggregation, MassFractOverlappingSph} have been implemented. Furthermore a simple scheme for importing data
    from the clipboard has been implemented, which e.g. allows to copy/paste
    data from spread-sheets directly into {\tt SASfit}.
    Corrected a bug for the form factors  \texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a*}
    \item[4.10.2007] ({SPHERE+Chains(RW), SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Rc, SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Nagg\tt SASfit} version 0.80)
    Next to the correction of some bugs a simulation option for
    multiple data sets has been implemented. Furthermore an option has been implemented to subtract a
    theoretical scattering contribution from the experimental data set, like e.g. a constant background signal.
    The format of the project files have up to now never been tested for compatibility. An attempt has
    been started to change this for the future versions.
    \item[20.8.2007] A couple of form factors for spherical, elliptical, cylindrical and very long rod-like
    micelles consisting of a homogeneous core and which are either grafted with Gaussian chains \texttt{*(RW)*},
    or grafted with semi-flexible self-avoiding and interacting chains \texttt{*(SAW)*} or
    a corona with a power-law decaying profile $r^{-\alpha}$ \texttt{*(R$\hat{~}$-a)*}
    have been implemented:
    \texttt{
    SPHERE+Chains(RW), SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Rc, SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Nagg,
    SPHERE+Chains(SAW), SPHERE+Chains(SAW)\_Rc, SPHERE+Chains(SAW)\_Nagg,
    SPHERE+R$\hat{~}$-a, SPHERE+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Rc, SPHERE+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Nagg,
    ELL+Chains(RW), ELL+Chains(RW)\_Rc, ELL+Chains(RW)\_Nagg,
    CYL+Chains(RW), CYL+Chains(RW)\_Rc, CYL+Chains(RW)\_Nagg,
    ROD+Chains(RW), ROD+Chains(RW)\_Rc, ROD+Chains(RW)\_nagg,
    ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a, ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Rc, ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a\_nagg
    }
    \item[30.6.2007] Rudimental copy algorithm to copy plots or parameters into window-clipboard. Everything
    is copied in wmf-format and the option only works fine for information in non-scrolled widgets.
    Copy-option can be activated with right mouse button or double click of left mouse button.
    A triaxial ellipsoidal (\texttt{triaxEllShell}) shell with semiaxis \texttt{a}, \texttt{b}, \texttt{c}
    and shell thickness \texttt{t} is available.
    \item[4.6.2007] Implementation of form factors for cylindrical shells with circular cross-section and capped ends
    (\texttt{CylShell2}) and without capped ends (\texttt{CylShell1}) together with an approximation for very long
    cylindrical shells (\texttt{LongCylShell})
    \item[27.3.2007] Implementation of form factors for bi-continuous systems (\texttt{TeubnerStrey} and \texttt{DAB})
    \item[23.2.2007] Implementation of the structure factor for a system of charged, spheroidal objects in a
    dielectric medium according to the RMSA model of Hayter and Penfold
    \item[11.11.2006]  Implementation of a semiflexible polymer according to Kholodenko,
    some form factors with plane geometry, which are intended to be used with lamellar structure factors
    (\texttt{homogenousXS}, \texttt{TwoInfinitelyThinPlates},
     \texttt{LayeredCentroSymmetricXS}, \texttt{BiLayerGauss}), a sphere with Gaussian chains attached
    \texttt{SphereWithGaussChains} and a slightly different parametrised form factor named
    \texttt{BlockCopolymerMicelle}.
    An additional option for reading ASCII data files is now available,
    which allows to convert values for the scattering vector from
    nm$^{-1}$ into \AA$^{-1}$ and vice versa. \sloppy
    \item[23.10.2006] Implementation of a polydsiperse star \texttt{PolydisperseStar} and
    of flexible ring polymers \texttt{FlexibleRingPolymer} and \texttt{mMemberedTwistedRing}.
    \item[22.10.2006] Implementation of the form factor of a flexible polymer with Gaussian statistics
    (in different parameterisations \verb"Gauss", \verb"Gauss2", \verb"Gauss3") for a polydisperse flexible
    polymer with Gaussian statistics (\verb"GaussPoly") and a flexible ring of polymer with Gaussian statistics
    (\verb"FlexiblePolymerRing")
    \item[12.10.2006] Under the menu option \verb"Calc/DLS..." next to a cumulant fit also
      a double stretched exponential decay can be selected to fit dynamic light scattering data.
    \item[5.10.2006] Implementation of a spherical shell with a diffuse
      (expontential) scattering length density profile inside the shell
      caused by solvent penetration into the shell
    \item[13.9.2006] Implementation of a form factor for spheres
      with gaussian chains attached.
    \item[19.7.2006] First release (current version: 0.71)
      at the moment only a windows version is available. The
      installation files for tcl/tk and blt are included in the
      distribution file.
