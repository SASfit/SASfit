  abstract  = {An attractive force appears between particles suspended in solutions
	of macromolecules when there is neither direct interaction between
	two particles nor energetic interaction between particles and solute
	macromolecules. The magnitude of this force is of the order of the
	osmotic pressure of the solution of macromolecules and the range
	is of the order of the diameter of macromolecules. This force is
	calculated as a function of concentration, shape, and charge of macromolecules,
	and it is shown that it becomes stronger in solutions of chain macromolecules
	or of macromolecules of dissymmetrical shape than in solutions of
	rigid spherical macromolecules at the same net concentration. If
	macromolecules have charge, the force can be greatly intensified.
	In every case numerical estimation is made, and it is found that
	actually this kind of force can have a remarkable influence on the
	state of suspended particles. Numerical examples of the critical
	concentration of particles at their macroscopic aggregation are given.
	Finally a short description is added on the effect of energetic interaction
	between particles and macromolecules.},

	in the shell have been investigated by small-angle neutron scattering

	the structure, and the real space particle structure is expressed

	a variation of cross-linker in the shell mainly effects the dimensions
	of the shell. The influence on the core structure was interpreted
	as resulting from an elastic force developed from the swollen shell.
	At temperatures below the core LCST, the core cannot swell to its
	native size (i.e., in the absence of a shell), because the maximum
	expanded shell network prohibits further swelling. Thus, depending
	on temperature, the shell either expands or compresses the core.},

  abstract  = {We review the present status of applications of integral equation
	theories (IETs) for the radial distribution function g(r), to the
	determination of phase diagrams and stability conditions of simple
	and charged classical fluids. After having recalled some basic concepts
	and definitions in the structural description of fluid systems, a
	number of \{IETs\} are examined by reporting the constituting equations
	and solution procedures; these last are discussed also in relationship
	with the actual calculation of coexistence lines and description
	of the critical behavior of each envisaged theory. In this context,
	the crucial role played by the fulfilment of thermodynamic consistency
	in the improvement of the performances of the various approximations,
	is highlighted. Then, a number of results of phase diagram determinations,
	phase stability investigations, and estimates of critical exponents,
	are reported for several neutral and charged model fluids (and their
	mixtures) such as the hard sphere fluid, the square-well fluid, the
	hard-core Yukawa fluid, the Lennard-Jones fluid, and charged hard
	spheres in different regimes of density, sizes and charges. Calculations
	of the phase diagram of a rigid molecule model of \{C60\} are also
	reported. Besides their theoretical interest, these models are investigated
	by many authors also because they can reasonably mimic real systems
	like rare gas liquids, electrolyte solutions, molten salts, neutral
	and charged micellar systems, and colloidal solutions. The related
	experimental evidence is therefore frequently referred, and comparison
	with experimental results is also performed in some case. Theoretical
	results are usually presented in parallel with the available computer
	simulation data, which are extensively quoted both with the aim of
	a systematic assessment of the theories, and in order to offer a
	more complete scenario of phase behavior calculations in classical
	fluids. Perspectives and advantages of future extensions and applications
	of \{IETs\} in different physical contexts in which phase coexistence
	conditions seem worth of a timely investigation, are also discussed.},

	the study of the static properties of solutions or suspensions of
	colloidal particles. The latter are macromolecular entities with
	typical sizes ranging from 1 nm to 1$\mu$m and their suspension typically
	contain, in addition to the solvent, smaller components such as salt
	ions or free polymer chains. The theoretical tool introduced is the
	effective Hamiltonian which formally results by a canonical trace
	over the smaller degrees of freedom for a fixed, "frozen" configuration
	of the large ones. After presenting the formal definitions of this
	effective Hamiltonian, we proceed with the applications to some common
	soft matter systems having a variable softness and ranging from free
	polymer chains to hard colloidal particles. We begin from the extreme
	case of nondiverging effective interactions between ultrasoft polymer
	chains and derive an exact criterion to determine the topology of
	the phase diagrams of such systems. We use star polymers with a variable
	arm number f as a hybrid system in order to interpolate between these
	two extremes. By deriving an effective interaction between stars
	we can monitor the change in the phase behavior of a system as the
	steepness of the repulsion between its constituent particles increases.
	We also review recent results on the nature and the effects of short-range
	attractions on the phase diagrams of spherical, nonoverlapping colloidal
	particles.},

  abstract  = {Charge-stabilized suspensions of spherically shaped particles show
	a variety of interesting properties. As a consequence, there has
	been considerable interest in the investigation of the microstructure
	and the dynamic properties of well characterized model systems, such
	as polystyrene spheres dispersed in water and charged silica spheres
	dispersed in an organic solvent. Among various experimental techniques,
	static and dynamic light scattering have been the major tools for
	the characterization of colloidal suspensions. Whereas there is an
	essentially quantitative understanding of monodisperse suspensions,
	only very recently good progress was achieved, both theoretically
	and experimentally, in understanding certain properties of colloidal
	mixtures and intrinsically polydisperse one-component suspensions.
	Colloidal mixtures show additional phenomena, e.g., a variety of
	microstructures and phase behaviour, tracer-diffusion and interdiffusion,
	which do not exist in monodisperse systems. This article offers a
	survey on our current knowledge of the dynamics and statics of charge-stabilized
	suspensions in the fluid phase, with emphasis on the authors own
	work. It further contains a summary of basic concepts, and of analytical
	and numerical methods, which are relevant for the theoretical description
	of charge-stabilized suspensions. Special effort is made to point
	out the salient differences between colloidal mixtures and monodisperse
	suspensions. The calculated or computer-simulated quantities characterizing
	the suspensions are compared, whenever available, with the results
	of light scattering experiments. The article is divided into two
	major parts. The first part (chapters 2 and 3) is concerned with
	static properties. It includes a discussion of the origin of the
	repulsive and attractive forces between charged colloidal particles,
	the concepts of the effective charge and global correlation functions,
	the influence of the finite size of the counterions on the microstructure
	of concentrated ionic micellar solutions, and the extension of the
	rescaled mean spherical approximation to colloidal mixtures. The
	central issue of the first part is, however, the theoretical modeling
	of intrinsic polydispersity, and the calculation of static structure
	factors and radial distribution functions by various integral equation
	methods. The relative accuracy of these methods is assessed from
	the comparisons with computer simulations and light scattering results.
	The main body of this article is contained in the second part (chapter
	4), which is concerned with the dynamics of charge-stabilized suspensions.
	A thorough discussion of the various levels of description of the
	suspension dynamics is given in terms of the time scales characterizing
	various relaxation processes associated with the colloidal particles
	and the molecules of the host fluid. The description of the dynamics
	of the colloidal particles, based on the generalized Smoluchowski
	equation, is justified for the time interval accessible in dynamic
	light scattering experiments. A summary of general properties of
	the generalized Smoluchowski equation is provided, and various ordering
	relations for diffusion coefficients are presented. The combined
	influence of the electrostatic and solvent mediated hydrodynamic
	interactions on the short-time dynamics of monodisperse and polydisperse
	charge-stabilized suspensions is investigated in great detail. It
	is shown that the effect of hydrodynamic interaction is strongly
	enhanced by the presence of long-ranged electrostatic repulsion,
	and its influence is more pronounced for collective diffusion than
	for short-time self-diffusion. The additional influence of polydispersity
	is found to be quite significant. Finally, a thorough study of tracer-diffusion
	in charge-stabilized suspensions is presented. Mean square displacements
	and long-time tracer-diffusion coefficients are calculated with two
	alternative approximations, i.e., a mode-coupling scheme and a single
	relaxation time ansatz. The range of validity of these approximations
	is assessed by numerous comparisons with Brownian dynamics simulation
	results, and with large-wavenumber dynamic light scattering and forced-Rayleigh
	data. It is observed that tracer-diffusion is quite sensitive to
	the amount of intrinsic polydispersity.},

  abstract        = {The accuracy of the Derjaguin expressions for the depletion potential
	of large spheres due to small spheres, discs, and rods is analysed.
	To that end, we subdivide the generalised Gibbs adsorption equation
	into three contributions. We determine these contributions both in
	first order of curvature of the large spheres as well as exact for
	small spheres, discs, and rods up to first order in the number density
	of the depletion agents. The gain of volume in the bulk when the
	depletion zones of the large spheres overlap is the same for spheres,
	discs, and rods of equally characteristic sizes. The Derjaguin approximation
	underestimates the exact solution because of the neglected curvature.
	The number of particles that fit in the gap between the two large
	spheres as well as the amount that can enter a single depletion zone,
	are both underestimated by the Derjaguin approximation for discs
	and rods to relatively the same extent. Due to the intermediate excluded
	volume of the discs, the correction of the last two contributions
	just cancels the error in the first one. Small spheres only exhibit
	the first contribution, whereas for rods the other parts overcompensate
	the first. We can thus explain why the depletion potential of large
	spheres due to small spheres is underestimated by the Derjaguin approximation,
	is surprisingly accurate for discs, and is overestimated for rod-like
	depletion agents.s},

  abstract  = {The applicability of full-q-range models to fit low-resolution X-ray
	diffraction data from multibilayers exhibiting only weak quasi-Bragg
	peak scattering has been analysed. The models consider different
	structure factors, accounting for different types of lattice disorder
	caused by stacking faults or bending fluctuations. Numerical tests
	of the models, considering instrumental influence of a line-focus
	collimation system, demonstrated that Bragg peak line shapes given
	by different lattice disorders cannot be discerned. However, line-shape
	parameters can be determined for a particular sample, if the type
	of disorder is known a priori. This has been verified by comparing
	the experimental results for the fluctuation parameter of palmitoyl-oleoyl
	phosphatidylcholine (POPC) as a function of temperature with high-resolution
	data on the same lipid. Tests further show that the calculation of
	structural parameters, such as the membrane thickness or the extent
	of the interbilayer water region, is not obscured by the smearing
	imposed by the instrument. The model was further applied successfully
	to experimental data of lipid mixtures composed of sphingomyelin
	(SM)/POPC/cholesterol and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE)/dipalmitoyl
	phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG). The structural parameters determined
	give valuable insight into the physical state of the membrane system,
	which is not accessible when quasi-Bragg reflections only are considered.},

	well understood in terms of a free energy of formation based on a

  abstract  = {Oriented multilayers containing a membrane pair within the unit cell
	potentially possess both lattice disorder and substitution disorder.
	Lattice disorder occurs when there is a lack of long-range order
	in the lattice spacings produced by a variation in the nearest neighbor
	distances between unit cells. A simple form of substitution disorder
	can arise from a variation in the separation of the two membranes
	within the unit cells in the multilayer. Lattice disorder produces
	a monotonically increasing width for higher order lamellar "reflections"
	while simple substitution disorder produces an incoherent intensity
	underlying the coherent intensity. A generalized Patterson function
	analysis has been developed for treating lamellar diffraction from
	lattice disordered multilayers. This analysis allows the identification
	of the autocorrelation function of the unit cell electron density
	profile and its subsequent deconvolution to provide the unit cell
	electron density profile. A recursive procedure has been developed
	for separating the incoherent intensity from the coherent intensity
	via a Gaussian probability model of the membrane intra-pair separation.
	In cases studied so far both disorders can be quantitatively accounted
	for and eliminated from interfering with the phasing of the coherent
	intensity or distorting the derived electron density profile. Lamellar
	X-ray diffraction data from intact retinal rods, using either film
	or position sensitive detectors, shows severe effects of both forms
	of disorder which have not been taken into account in past analysis
	of such data. We have applied our analysis to the data on dark adapted
	rod outer segments in electrophysiologically intact retinas of Chabre
	and Cavaggioni (unpublished). An electron density profile is derived
	at 25 A resolution. The lattice nearest neighbor spacing has a variation
	of +/- 19 A out of a 295 A repeat. The intra-unit cell membrane pair
	center to center distance of 88 A varies +/-8 A."},

	by a model hard sphere structure factor S(q), and the average radial
	density profiles Ï†(r) are calculated from the amplitude of the form
	factor A(q) and the structure factor S(q). By this procedure, a direct
	real space description of the spatial ordering in the neighborhood
	of a single particle is obtained. The overall particle size and the
	correlation length Î¾ of the concentration fluctuations of the internal
	polymer network decrease with concentration, revealing the increasing
	compression of the spheres. Thus, the particle form factor Pinho(q)
	of the swollen PNiPAM microgels depends on concentration. The particleâˆ’particle
	interaction potential does not change significantly between 25 and
	32 Â°C. Even approximately 1 K below the lower critical solution
	temperature (LCST), the experimental scattering intensity distributions
	I(q)/c are described very well by the hard sphere structure factor
	when an equivalent hard sphere particle size RHS and volume fraction
	Î·HS are used. Microgels with different degrees of cross-linking
	and particle size resemble true hard sphere behavior up to effective
	volume fractions of Ï†eff < 0.35. At higher effective volume fractions
	Ï†eff > 0.35 strong deviations from true hard spheres are observed.
	Interpenetration of the outer, less cross-linked regions of the soft
	spheres as well as particle compression occurred at higher concentrations.
	In agreement with this, the equilibrium colloidal phase behavior
	and rheology also has some features of soft sphere systems. At temperatures
	well above the LCST, the interaction potential becomes strongly attractive
	and the collapsed microgel spheres form aggregates consisting of
	flocculated particles without significant long-range order. Hence,
	an attractive interaction potential in concentrated suspensions of
	PNiPAM microgels leads to distinctively different structures as compared
	to attractive hard sphere colloids. When the peculiar structural
	properties of the PNiPAM microgels are considered, they can be used
	as model systems in colloidal science.},

	coefficients calculated by a Monte Carlo integration. New data for
	pressure and internal energy are obtained by molecular dynamics simulations
	with attention paid to finite-size errors and properties of the Andersen
	thermostat. The data and virial coefficients are correlated by a
	formula for the Helmholtz free energy. We also propose a new closure
	for the Ornstein-Zernike equation and test several other closures.},

	on a nanometer scale. Applying a cyclic perturbation to the sample
	by an oscillating magnetic field allows the polarization-dependent
	scattering cross-sections to be extracted as time-dependent response.
	The potential of this special type of “physical” contrast variation
	technique is demonstrated with three examples of ferrofluids of different
	particle sizes and viscosities. The dynamics of magnetic moment reorientations
	turned out to be governed by different time scales. For a temperature-dependent
	fraction of individual mobile particles, a frequency-dependent phase
	shift and damping of the intensity modulation have been precisely
	determined and quantitatively explained using a Debye-like relaxation
	model. The characteristic relaxation times, $\tau$, in the liquid
	state of all samples scale with the particle volume and viscosity
	confirming a Brownian-relaxation mechanism. For the remaining fraction
	of particles that form locally ordered domains the orientation distribution
	of the dynamically arrested static moments has been quantified by
	an order parameter $S_1^\textrm{arr}$, which is not accessible with
	nonpolarized neutrons. In a high viscous Co and a magnetite-based
	ferrofluid, $S_1^\textrm{arr}$ corresponds to maximal alignment of
	the static moments in the liquid state and to a gradual decrease
	at lower temperatures when the solvent is frozen. In a low viscosity
	Co-ferrofluid almost no preferred alignment of the arrested particle
	moments was observed. In the magnetite-based ferrofluid with the
	highest dipolar attraction energy an additional phase shift has been
	detected which increases with frequency and magnitude of the magnetic
	field. This indicates clearly that the set-up of local particle ordering
	in distorted hexagonal arrangement is delayed with respect to the
	moment alignment in the time varying magnetic field.},

	of the time correlation function of scattered light, is written as
	a series involving the first few cumulants (or moments) of the distribution
	of particle diffusion constants. Frisken (2001 Appl. Opt. 40 [http://dx.doi.org/10.1364/AO.40.004087]

	a non-linear, iterative, analysis of the data has advantages over
	the linear least-squares analysis used originally. In order to explore
	further the potential and limitations of cumulant methods we analyse,
	by both linear and non-linear methods, computer-generated data with
	realistic noise, where the parameters of the distribution can be
	set explicitly. We find that, with modern computers, non-linear analysis
	is straightforward and robust. The mean and variance of the distribution
	of diffusion constants can be obtained quite accurately for distributions
	of width (standard deviation/mean) up to about 0.6, but there appears
	to be little prospect of obtaining meaningful higher moments.},

  abstract  = {Two- and three-parameter functions commonly used for the description
	of the molecular weight distribution of polymers were determined
	from gel permeation chromatography data for 80 water-soluble samples
	of polymers derived from glutamic acid. Two methods were applied:
	the moment method in which two or three different molecular weight
	averages are used, and a least squares adjustment method using the
	whole chromatogram. Convergence difficulties observed in the past
	were overcome, and a fully automated computer procedure was developed.
	The moment method, although virtually the only one still in use,
	often gives inexact results: sometimes the type of two-parameter
	distribution is wrongly assigned, or the description of experimental
	data cannot be improved by adding yet another parameter. On the other
	hand, in all cases under study the least squares method gave a function
	which describes the real distribution within the limits of experimental
	error. Although the majority of samples could be described by employing
	one of the common two-parameter functions, the more general three-parameter
	function, encompassing all two-parameter ones as special cases, has
	the advantage of wider applicability. It is shown that the standard
	gel permeation chromatography data often cannot provide reliable
	values of higher molecular weight moment averages, including Mz.
	Hence, it may be inferred that in the description of the experimental
	molecular weight distribution curves the least squares method should
	be preferred over the moment method.},

Unfortunately, the kinds of correlation functions inappropriate for the description of geological structures are often assumed and applied. The most frequently used types of correlation functions are thus summarized and reviewed in this paper, together with an explanation of the physical meaning of their parameters.{\textparagraph}A stationary random medium is assumed to be realized in terms of a white noise filtered by a spectral filter. The spectral filter is considered isotropic, in a simple general form enabling the random media used in geophysics to be specified. The medium correlation functions, corresponding to the individual special cases of the general random medium (Gaussian, exponential, von K{\'a}rm{\'a}n, self-affine, Kummer), are then derived and briefly discussed. The corresponding elliptically anisotropic correlation functions can simply be obtained by linear coordinate transforms.},

It is here treated as a special case of two-dimensional aerial smoothing in which the aerial beam is allowed to spin about its centre as it moves about the sky. It is shown that the resolution obtainable is set by the cross-sectional profile of the strip beam in the narrow dimension. Thus, when the strip reduces to a line, the resolution is complete and full reconstruction of the true distribution is possible; but scans must be made in all directions. In the general case it is shown that there is a principal solution, and that a finite number of scans suffices to determine it. A method is presented for reconstructing the principal solution from the observed data.},

  abstract  = {Abstract It is shown that various aspects of the X-ray fibre-diagrams of TMV can be explained by the presence of some form of helical groove (with its resulting helical ridge) on the surface of the virus particle. The groove follows the line of the main protein helix (pitch 23 A) and is approximately 30 A in depth. The form of the groove and ridge is such as to permit a high degree of interlocking between neighbouring particles, and it is suggested that the ridge may in fact consist of a series of protuberances, one corresponding to each protein sub-unit. As a result, the surface area of the virus particle must be considerably greater than that of a smooth cylinder of the same diameter, and this may be important in determining the chemical properties of the intact virus.Résumé Les auteurs montrent que différents aspects des diagrammes de fibre aux rayons X du TMV peuvent s'expliquer par la présence d'une certaine forme de rainure hélicoïdale (avec sa crête hélicoïdale résultante) à la surface de la particule de virus. La rainure suit la ligne de l'hélice protéique principale (pas 23 A) et a une profondeur de 30 A environ. La forme de la rainure et de la crête est telle qu'elle permet un degré élevé d'interpénétration entre particules voisines, et les auteurs suggèrent que la crête peut en fait être constituée d'une série de protubérances, chacune correspondant à une sub-unité protéique. Il en résulte que l'aire de la surface de la particule de virus doit être considérablement plus grande que celle d'un cylindre lisse de même diamètre; cette conformation oeut jouer un róle important dans la détermination des propriétés chimiques du virus intact.Zusammenfassung Es wird bewiesen, dass verschiedene Aspekte der TMV-Röntgen-Faserdiagramme durch die Anwesenheit einer Art von Schraubenrinne (mit der sich daraus ergebenden Schraubenkannte) auf der Viruspartikeloberfläche erklärt werden können. Die Rinne folgt der Linie der Haupt-proteinschraube (Steighöle 23 A); ihre Tiefe ist ungefähr 30 A. Die Form von Rinne und Kante ermöglicht einen hohen Verflechtungsgrad der Nachbarpartikeln; die Annahme wird befürwortet, dass die Kante aus einer Reihe von Auswüchsen bestehen könnte, deren jeder einer Proteinsubeinheit entsprechen würde. Die Viruspartikeloberfläche muss daher bedeutend grösser sein als diejenige eines glatten Zylinders mit dem gleichen Durchmesser. Dies kann bei Bestimmung der chemischen Eigenschaften des intakten Virus von Wichtigkeit sein.},

  abstract  = {A model has been developed to calculate the diffraction given by a disordered set of thick coils of helical conformation. Double coils placed inside a cylinder of different density are considered. The cylinder accounts for the presence of substances which may interact with the double coil in a random manner. The thickness of each coil, pitch and radius of gyration, outer cylinder diameter and its density are the parameters that influence the diffraction maxima observed. It is demonstrated that when the parameter {\it Z} (pitch/radius) increases, the peaks tend to overlap. The relative position ({$\alpha$}) of the two coils is also studied. When they are diametrically opposed, only even layer-line peaks are detected. At intermediate positions, other peaks appear, the intensity of which depends strongly on the precise value of {$\alpha$}. An interesting result is that the relative position of the peaks for any single coil is constant and does not depend on the dimensions of the coil. The central scattering increases considerably if one of the two-component coils becomes a straight cylinder coaxial with the primitive coil. As a result the lower layer-line peaks do not show. On the other hand, the intensity due to the central equatorial peak diminishes when some packing order is introduced between coils. The model is suitable for interpreting the specific case of nucleohistone patterns.},

  abstract  = {Analytic expressions for the particle scattering factor of stiff chains have been derived, both for the wormlike and a discrete chain model with an axial symmetric potential of hindered rotation. The angular distribution functions agree well with the results of Monte Carlo calculations by Heine, Kratky \&amp; Roeppert (1962), if the chains are longer than five persistence lengths. The particle scattering factor of short chains can be well represented by the simple Guinier approximation. A transition point from the behaviour of a coil to that of the rod-like short chain sections has been determined by graphical extrapolation and appears at Xa = 2.87 {\textpm} 0.05. The difference between the wormlike and the discrete chain models turned out to be smaller than 14\% even for an alkane type chain with free rotation of the chain elements and decreases with increasing chain stiffness. The influence of the cross-section has been taken into account by representing the chain by a pearl necklace. Comparison with X -ray small angle scattering measurements of a cellulosetricarbanilate reveals close similarities between calculated and experimental curves.},

  abstract  = {Spin-echo-based small-angle neutron scattering techniques like spin-echo SANS (SESANS) or spin-echo modulated SANS (SEMSANS) as well as dark-field (DF) imaging are directly sensitive to \tilde{G}(\delta), which is the projection of the scattering length density autocorrelation function \tilde{\gamma}(r). Here, a simplified transformation cycle relating the spherically symmetric correlation function \tilde{\gamma}(r), the projected correlation function \tilde{G}(\delta) and the macroscopic small-angle scattering cross section d{$\Sigma$}/d{$\Omega$} is introduced. The suggested changes to the cycle make it easier to include size distribution on an absolute scale if the data from the different techniques are fitted simultaneously. As up to now only very few analytical expressions for the projected correlation function are known, a numerical transformation of known scattering functions into the projected correlation function in the {\it SASfit} software package is supplied. Furthermore, a new analytical expression for the projected correlation function for polymers that can be described by the generalized Gaussian coil model is provided. For this polymer model, the Hankel transform used to calculate \tilde{G}(0) from the SANS signal is divergent for a certain parameter range describing a polymer in a good solvent and finite in the case of a poor solvent. It is therefore a suitable example of how the experimentally available {\it q} range can strongly influence the obtained results.},

The symmetry of the scatterers may be one dimensional (lamellar), two dimensional (cylindrical) or three dimensional (spherical). Previously this problem has been treated either by a two-step approach with the distance distribution as an intermediate [Glatter (1981). {\it J. Appl. Cryst.} {\bf 14}, 101{--}108] or in a single step using spherical harmonics [Svergun, Feigin & Schedrin (1982). {\it Acta Cryst.} A{\bf 38}, 827{--}835]. A combination of these two methods is presented here, where the density distribution is estimated using constraints without the explicit use of an intermediate distribution. A maximum entropy constraint is introduced for this problem and the results are compared with the results of the conventional smoothness constraint. Bayesian methods are used for estimation of the overall noise level of the experimental data and for the maximum dimension of the density distribution. The method described is tested on both simulated and experimental data and shown to provide reliable estimates for the Guinier radius and maximum dimension. In both cases the effects of minor deviations from the assumed symmetry as well as incorrect background subtraction are studied.},

	based on angular scattering measurements is the inverse problem which
	can be expressed in terms of the Fredholm integral equation of the
	first kind when single and incoherent scattering modeled by Mie theory
	is assumed. However, the problem is highly ill-conditioned when discretized.
	When one incorporates two constraints to be satisfied by the sought
	PSD: nonnegativity of \{PSD\} values and normalization of \{PSD\}
	to unity when integrated over the whole range of particle size into
	the Regularized Least Squares (RLS) method, one obtains the proposed
	Constrained Regularized Least Squares (CRLS) method which consists
	in solving the quadratic programming problem. Accuracy (bias) and
	uncertainty of the \{CRLS\} solutions were assessed in the study.
	The study refers to the one similar for spectral extinction measurements
	performed before. Results of the simulation sensitivity study prove
	that the \{CRLS\} method is capable of retrieving \{PSD\} functions
	with accuracy and uncertainty satisfactory for many industrial applications.
	However, the method does not manage to reconstruct bimodal \{PSD\}
	functions so that both modes are distinguishable. Retrieved \{PSD\}
	satisfies physical constraints inherently.},

	tool for evaluating the structure of a molecule in solution and represents
	the maximum structural information that can be derived from solution
	scattering data without further assumptions. Most current instrumentation
	for scattering experiments (typically CCD detectors) generates a
	finely pixelated two-dimensional image. In contin{\-}uation of the
	standard practice with earlier one-dimensional detectors, these images
	are typically reduced to a one-dimensional profile of scattering
	inten{\-}sities, {\it I}({\it q}), by circular averaging of the two-dimensional
	image. Indirect Fourier transformation methods are then used to reconstruct
	{\it P}({\it r}) from {\it I}({\it q}). Substantial advantages in
	data analysis, however, could be achieved by directly estimating
	the {\it P}({\it r}) curve from the two-dimensional images. This
	article describes a Bayesian framework, using a Markov chain Monte
	Carlo method, for estimating the parameters of the indirect transform,
	and thus {\it P}({\it r}), directly from the two-dimensional images.
	Using simulated detector images, it is demonstrated that this method
	yields {\it P}({\it r}) curves nearly identical to the reference
	{\it P}({\it r}). Furthermore, an approach for evaluating spatially
	correlated errors (such as those that arise from a detector point
	spread function) is evaluated. Accounting for these errors further
	improves the precision of the {\it P}({\it r}) estimation. Experimental
	scattering data, where no ground truth reference {\it P}({\it r})
	is available, are used to demonstrate that this method yields a scattering
	and detector model that more closely reflects the two-dimensional
	data, as judged by smaller residuals in cross-validation, than {\it
	P}({\it r}) obtained by indirect transformation of a one-dimensional
	profile. Finally, the method allows concurrent estimation of the
	beam center and {\it D}${\sb max}$, the longest interatomic distance
	in {\it P}({\it r}), as part of the Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo
	method, reducing experimental effort and providing a well defined
	protocol for these parameters while also allowing estimation of the
	covariance among all parameters. This method provides parameter estimates
	of greater precision from the experimental data. The observed improvement
	in precision for the traditionally problematic {\it D}${\sb max}$
	is particularly noticeable.},

	ago in China from observations of the Earth shaking caused by large
	earthquakes (Lee et al., 2003) have gone a long way in their development
	from an initial, intuitive stage to a modern science employing the
	newest technological and theoretical achievements. In spite of this
	enormous development, geophysical research still faces the same basic
	limitation. The only available information about the Earth comes
	from measurement at its surface or from space. Only very limited
	information can be acquired by direct measurements. It is not surprising,
	therefore, that geophysicists have contributed significantly to the
	development of the inverse theory{\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\textquotedblright}the
	theory of inference about sought parameters from indirect measurements.
	For a long time this inference was understood as the task of estimating
	parameters used to describe the Earth's structure or processes within
	it, like earthquake ruptures. The problem was traditionally solved
	by using optimization techniques following the least absolute value
	and least squares criteria formulated by Laplace and Gauss. Today
	the inverse theory faces a new challenge in its development. In many
	geophysical and related applications, obtaining the model {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\oe}best
	fitting{\^{a}}{\texteuro}? a given set of data according to a selected
	optimization criterion is not sufficient any more. We need to know
	how plausible the obtained model is or, in other words, how large
	the uncertainties are in the final solutions. This task can hardly
	be addressed in the framework of the classical optimization approach.
	The probabilistic inverse theory incorporates a statistical point
	of view, according to which all available information, including
	observational data, theoretical predictions and a priori knowledge,
	can be represented by probability distributions. According to this
	reasoning, the solution of the inverse problem is not a single, optimum
	model, but rather the a posteriori probability distribution over
	the model space which describes the probability of a given model
	being the true one. This path of development of the inverse theory
	follows a pragmatic need for a reliable and efficient method of interpreting
	observational data. The aim of this chapter is to bring together
	two elements of the probabilistic inverse theory. The first one is
	a presentation of the theoretical background of the theory enhanced
	by basic elements of the Monte Carlo computational technique. The
	second part provides a review of the solid earth applications of
	the probabilistic inverse theory.},

	and polydispersity in the structure of materials to multiple dimensions.
	In one dimension, the description of heterogeneity by means of Mellin
	convolution is well known. In several papers by the author, the method
	has been applied to the analysis of data from materials with one-dimensional
	structure (layer stacks or fibrils along their principal axis). According
	to this concept, heterogeneous structures built from polydisperse
	ensembles of structural units are advantageously described by the
	Mellin convolution of a representative template structure with the
	size distribution of the templates. Hence, the polydisperse ensemble
	of similar structural units is generated by superposition of dilated
	templates. This approach is particularly attractive considering the
	advantageous mathematical properties enjoyed by the Mellin convolution.
	Thus, average particle size, and width and skewness of the particle
	size distribution can be determined from scattering data without
	the need to model the size distributions themselves. The present
	theoretical treatment demonstrates that the concept is generally
	extensible to dilation in multiple dimensions. Moreover, in an analogous
	manner, a representative cluster of correlated particles ({\it e.g.}
	layer stacks or microfibrils) can be considered as a template on
	a higher level. Polydispersity of such clusters is, again, described
	by subjecting the template structure to the generalized Mellin convolution.
	The proposed theory leads to a simple pathway for the quantitative
	determination of polydispersity and heterogeneity parameters. Consistency
	with the established theoretical approach of polydispersity in scattering
	theory is demonstrated. The method is applied to the best advantage
	in the field of soft condensed matter when anisotropic nanostructured
	materials are to be characterized by means of small-angle scattering

	this technique is only useful for dilute solutions because, for higher
	concentrations, particle interactions can no longer be neglected.
	Thus an advanced technique was developed as a generalized version,
	the so-called generalized indirect Fourier transformation (GIFT).
	It is based on the simultaneous determination of the form factor,
	representing the intraparticle contributions, and the structure factor,
	describing the interparticle contributions. The former can be determined
	absolutely free from model assumptions, whereas the latter has to
	be calculated according to an adequate model. In this paper, various
	models for the structure factor are compared, {\it e.g.} the effective
	structure factor for polydisperse hard spheres, the averaged structure
	factor, the local monodisperse approximation and the decoupling approximation.
	Furthermore, the structure factor for polydisperse rod-like particles
	is presented. As the model-free evaluation of small-angle scattering
	data is an essential point of the GIFT technique, the use of a structure
	factor without any influence of the form amplitude is advisable,
	at least during the first evaluation procedure. Therefore, a series
	of simulations are performed to check the possibility of the representation
	of various structure factors (such as the effective structure factor
	for hard spheres or the structure factor for rod-like particles)
	by the less exact but much simpler averaged structure factor. In
	all the observed cases, it was possible to recover the exact form
	factor with a free determined parameter set for the structure factor.
	The resulting parameters of the averaged structure factor have to
	be understood as apparent model parameters and therefore have only
	limited physical relevance. Thus the GIFT represents a technique
	for the model independent evaluation of scattering data with a minimum
	of {\it a priori} information.},

Our results suggest that the anisotropy in translational diffusive motions, as well as the coupling between anisotropic translational diffusion and rotational diffusion, does not have a significant influence on the average characteristic linewidth, especially at small scattering angles. On the contrary, the simpler theory (without anisotropic diffusion) agrees better with experiments. Thus, although it is correct to take into account the anisotropy in translational motions, higher-order interactions should perhaps also be considered in order to improve the theoretical predictions.},

The intensity correlation functions of polarized scattered light were measured at various K2 values (K being the magnitude of the scattering vector), and the first cumulant$\Gamma$ of the field correlation function $G_1(\tau)$ was obtained by a cumulant expansion method. The apparent diffusion coefficient $\Gamm/K^2$ did not increase monotonically with K2 values and showed a distinct anomaly in an intermediate range of K. A theoretical formulation of $G_1(\tau)$ for a disc and an extremely oblate ellipsoidal shell of revolution (S. Fujime and K. Kubota, Biophys.

This study will provide experimental evidence of the feasibility of membrane studies by dynamic light scattering.},

	concepts and mathematical techniques of direct methods are analysed.
	Closer scrutiny ({\S} 2) reveals that severe inadequacies still impair
	the effectiveness of these methods. The asymptotic character of the
	series used to approximate joint distributions of structure factors
	demands that great caution be exercised to guarantee their accuracy,
	and this requirement can only be fulfilled if they are used within
	a multisolution algorithm in which the prior distribution of atoms
	is constantly updated so as to incorporate at every stage all the
	phase information assumed to that point. Further limitations follow
	from the traditional practice of approximating joint distributions
	by products of marginal distributions of single invariants. A scheme
	for simultaneously overcoming both difficulties is then proposed.
	The pivotal element of this scheme is a device, based on Jaynes's
	maximum-entropy principle, for exploiting the prior knowledge of
	some structure factors in the construction of the joint distributions
	of others conditional to that knowledge. Jaynes's maximum-entropy
	formalism is presented and systematically applied to the construction
	of the requisite non-uniform prior distributions of atoms in {\S}
	3. The problem of effectively approximating conditional distributions
	of very large numbers of structure factors is solved in {\S} 4 by
	a novel technique of 'maximum-entropy inversion' of Karle-Hauptman
	matrices, and the result obtained is shown to generalize the most
	sophisticated probabilistic formulae hitherto obtained. This procedure
	is proved in {\S} 5 to coincide with an enhancement of the standard
	method of asymptotic expansions by means of Daniels's saddlepoint
	approximation. Its relationship to determinantal methods is investigated
	in {\S} 6. A numerical algorithm for implementing these ideas is
	presented in {\S} 7, together with an application to data from the
	small protein Crambin, and a unified strategy for its use {\it ab
	initio} is described and discussed in {\S} 8. It is concluded that
	the phase-determination strategy proposed here will expedite the
	realization of the full potential of probabilistic direct methods,
	and is likely to bring macromolecular structures within their reach.},

  abstract     = {\{CONTIN\} is a portable Fortran \{IV\} package for inverting noisy
	linear operator equations. These problems occur in the analysis of
	data from a wide variety experiments. They are generally ill-posed
	problems, which means that errors in an unregularized inversion are
	unbounded. Instead, \{CONTIN\} seeks the optimal solution by incorporating
	parsimony and any statistical prior knowledge into the regularizor
	and absolute prior knowledge into equallity and inequality constraints.
	This can be greatly increase the resolution and accuracyh of the
	solution. \{CONTIN\} is very flexible, consisting of a core of about
	50 subprograms plus 13 small {\^{a}}{\texteuro}{\oe}USER{\^{a}}{\texteuro}?
	subprograms, which the user can easily modify to specify special-purpose
	constraints, regularizors, operator equations, simulations, statistical
	weighting, etc. Specjial collections of \{USER\} subprograms are
	available for photon correlation spectroscopy, multicomponent spectra,
	and Fourier-Bessel, Fourier and Laplace transforms. Numerically stable
	algorithms are used throughout CONTIN. A fairly precise definition
	of information content in terms of degrees of freedom is given. The
	regularization parameter can be automatically chosen on the basis
	of an F-test and confidence region. The interpretation of the latter
	and of error estimates based on the covariance matrix of the constrained
	regularized solution are discussed. The strategies, methods and options
	in \{CONTIN\} are outlined. The program itself is described in the
	following paper.},

	have recently risen by factors which may be as large as 10${\sp 5}$;
	formal problems {--} like assessing the information content of the
	data and retrieving that information in structural terms {--} have
	thus become of immediate practical interest. The general problem
	of the information content of scattering experiments is discussed;
	its mathematical expression is derived, which depends on both the
	experimental data (observed values and estimated accuracy) and the
	{\it a priori} stochastic assumptions on the structure of the sample.
	The practical application of these notions to solution scattering
	studies involves several steps, three of which {--} choice of the
	degrees of freedom, data reduction and error analysis {--} are dealt
	with in this work. The first step is to specify the minimal number
	of independent parameters necessary and sufficient to describe the
	whole of the scattering properties of the system. Whenever the solute
	particles are of finite dimensions the entire scattering curve is
	defined by its values at a one-dimensional lattice; if, moreover,
	the asymptotic trend of the scattering curves is known, then the
	degrees of freedom are the ideal intensities at a finite number of
	points plus a small number of parameters describing the asymptotic
	trend. It is also possible to include among the degrees of freedom
	a few subsidiary parameters like the normalization factors. The next
	step is, starting from a composite set of data, to determine the
	most probable numerical value of each degree of freedom and to evaluate
	its range of uncertainty. This is discussed within the framework
	of variable-contrast studies, assuming that the invariant-volume
	hypothesis is fulfilled. An algorithm is formulated which treats
	all the experimental observations and determines simultaneously all
	the degrees of freedom and the error matrix. The algorithm also allows
	one to introduce additional linear constraints on the degrees of
	freedom. As an example, the algorithm is applied to solution X-ray
	scattering data recorded with a low-density serum lipoprotein. The
	determination of the maximal chord of the particle {--} an important
	parameter in the informational analysis {--} turns out to be rather
	tricky.},

The L-curve thus gives insight into the regularizing properties of the underlying regularization method, and it is an aid in choosing an appropriate regularization parameter for the given data.

  abstract  = {{\it SASfit} is one of the mature programs for small-angle scattering
	data analysis and has been available for many years. This ARTICLE
	describes the basic data processing and analysis workflow along with
	recent developments in the {\it SASfit} program package (version
	0.94.6). They include (i) advanced algorithms for reduction of oversampled
	data sets, (ii) improved confidence assessment in the optimized model
	parameters and (iii) a flexible plug-in system for custom user-provided
	models. A scattering function of a mass fractal model of branched
	polymers in solution is provided as an example for implementing a
	plug-in. The new {\it SASfit} release is available for major platforms
	such as Windows, Linux and MacOS. To facilitate usage, it includes
	comprehensive indexed documentation as well as a web-based wiki for
	peer collaboration and online videos demonstrating basic usage. The
	use of {\it SASfit} is illustrated by interpretation of the small-angle
	X-ray scattering curves of monomodal gold nanopARTICLEs (NIST reference
	material 8011) and bimodal silica nanopARTICLEs (EU reference material
	ERM-FD-102).},

  abstract  = {The metalog probability distributions can represent virtually any continuous shape
    with a single family of equations, making them far more flexible for representing
    data than the Pearson and other distributions. Moreover, the metalogs are easy to
    parameterize with data without non-linear parameter estimation, have simple closed-form
    equations, and offer a choice of boundedness. Their closed-form quantile functions
    (F-1) enable fast and convenient simulation. The previously unsolved problem of a
    closed-form analytical expression for the sum of lognormals is one application. Uses
    include simulating total impact of an uncertain number N of risk events (each with
    iid [independent, identically distributed] individual lognormal impact), noise in
    wireless communications networks and many others. Beyond sums of lognormals, the approach
    may be directly applied to represent and subsequently simulate sums of iid variables
    from virtually any continuous distribution, and, more broadly, to products, extreme
    values, or other many-to-one change of iid or correlated variables.},

It is also known that a weak point of this formula is the inefficiency when applied to a slowly decaying oscillatory integral over the half infinite interval such as I = Int_0^Infty f1(x) sin x dx, f1(x) is an algebraic function. In this paper we propose a new type of the double exponential formula which is quite efficient for evaluation of the integral mentioned above. It is based on such a transformation that makes the points of the formula after the transformation approach to the zeros of sin x double exponentially for large x.},

	(flat cylinders called bicelles) are formed. They have a radius of
	20 nm and a bilayer thickness of about 4 nm and are stable in the
	investigated temperature range of 2.5âˆ’30 Â°C. Fitting of SANS data
