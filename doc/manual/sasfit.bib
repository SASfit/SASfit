@ARTICLE{Naegele1996,
  author = {Gerhard Nägele},
  title = {On the dynamics and structure of charge-stabilized suspensions },
  journal = {Physics Reports },
  year = {1996},
  volume = {272},
  pages = {215 - 372},
  number = {5-6},
  abstract = {Charge-stabilized suspensions of spherically shaped particles show
	a variety of interesting properties. As a consequence, there has
	been considerable interest in the investigation of the microstructure
	and the dynamic properties of well characterized model systems, such
	as polystyrene spheres dispersed in water and charged silica spheres
	dispersed in an organic solvent. Among various experimental techniques,
	static and dynamic light scattering have been the major tools for
	the characterization of colloidal suspensions. Whereas there is an
	essentially quantitative understanding of monodisperse suspensions,
	only very recently good progress was achieved, both theoretically
	and experimentally, in understanding certain properties of colloidal
	mixtures and intrinsically polydisperse one-component suspensions.
	Colloidal mixtures show additional phenomena, e.g., a variety of
	microstructures and phase behaviour, tracer-diffusion and interdiffusion,
	which do not exist in monodisperse systems. This article offers a
	survey on our current knowledge of the dynamics and statics of charge-stabilized
	suspensions in the fluid phase, with emphasis on the authors own
	work. It further contains a summary of basic concepts, and of analytical
	and numerical methods, which are relevant for the theoretical description
	of charge-stabilized suspensions. Special effort is made to point
	out the salient differences between colloidal mixtures and monodisperse
	suspensions. The calculated or computer-simulated quantities characterizing
	the suspensions are compared, whenever available, with the results
	of light scattering experiments. The article is divided into two
	major parts. The first part (chapters 2 and 3) is concerned with
	static properties. It includes a discussion of the origin of the
	repulsive and attractive forces between charged colloidal particles,
	the concepts of the effective charge and global correlation functions,
	the influence of the finite size of the counterions on the microstructure
	of concentrated ionic micellar solutions, and the extension of the
	rescaled mean spherical approximation to colloidal mixtures. The
	central issue of the first part is, however, the theoretical modeling
	of intrinsic polydispersity, and the calculation of static structure
	factors and radial distribution functions by various integral equation
	methods. The relative accuracy of these methods is assessed from
	the comparisons with computer simulations and light scattering results.
	The main body of this article is contained in the second part (chapter
	4), which is concerned with the dynamics of charge-stabilized suspensions.
	A thorough discussion of the various levels of description of the
	suspension dynamics is given in terms of the time scales characterizing
	various relaxation processes associated with the colloidal particles
	and the molecules of the host fluid. The description of the dynamics
	of the colloidal particles, based on the generalized Smoluchowski
	equation, is justified for the time interval accessible in dynamic
	light scattering experiments. A summary of general properties of
	the generalized Smoluchowski equation is provided, and various ordering
	relations for diffusion coefficients are presented. The combined
	influence of the electrostatic and solvent mediated hydrodynamic
	interactions on the short-time dynamics of monodisperse and polydisperse
	charge-stabilized suspensions is investigated in great detail. It
	is shown that the effect of hydrodynamic interaction is strongly
	enhanced by the presence of long-ranged electrostatic repulsion,
	and its influence is more pronounced for collective diffusion than
	for short-time self-diffusion. The additional influence of polydispersity
	is found to be quite significant. Finally, a thorough study of tracer-diffusion
	in charge-stabilized suspensions is presented. Mean square displacements
	and long-time tracer-diffusion coefficients are calculated with two
	alternative approximations, i.e., a mode-coupling scheme and a single
	relaxation time ansatz. The range of validity of these approximations
	is assessed by numerous comparisons with Brownian dynamics simulation
	results, and with large-wavenumber dynamic light scattering and forced-Rayleigh
	data. It is observed that tracer-diffusion is quite sensitive to
	the amount of intrinsic polydispersity.},

  abstract = {The accuracy of the Derjaguin expressions for the depletion potential
	of large spheres due to small spheres, discs, and rods is analysed.
	To that end, we subdivide the generalised Gibbs adsorption equation
	into three contributions. We determine these contributions both in
	first order of curvature of the large spheres as well as exact for
	small spheres, discs, and rods up to first order in the number density
	of the depletion agents. The gain of volume in the bulk when the
	depletion zones of the large spheres overlap is the same for spheres,
	discs, and rods of equally characteristic sizes. The Derjaguin approximation
	underestimates the exact solution because of the neglected curvature.
	The number of particles that fit in the gap between the two large
	spheres as well as the amount that can enter a single depletion zone,
	are both underestimated by the Derjaguin approximation for discs
	and rods to relatively the same extent. Due to the intermediate excluded
	volume of the discs, the correction of the last two contributions
	just cancels the error in the first one. Small spheres only exhibit
	the first contribution, whereas for rods the other parts overcompensate
	the first. We can thus explain why the depletion potential of large
	spheres due to small spheres is underestimated by the Derjaguin approximation,
	is surprisingly accurate for discs, and is overestimated for rod-like
	depletion agents. Â© 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  number = {4â5},
  abstract = {In this work, we present a review of recently achieved progress in
	the field of soft condensed matter physics, and in particular on
	the study of the static properties of solutions or suspensions of
	colloidal particles. The latter are macromolecular entities with
	typical sizes ranging from 1 nm to 1$\mu$m and their suspension typically
	contain, in addition to the solvent, smaller components such as salt
	ions or free polymer chains. The theoretical tool introduced is the
	effective Hamiltonian which formally results by a canonical trace
	over the smaller degrees of freedom for a fixed, "frozen" configuration
	of the large ones. After presenting the formal definitions of this
	effective Hamiltonian, we proceed with the applications to some common
	soft matter systems having a variable softness and ranging from free
	polymer chains to hard colloidal particles. We begin from the extreme
	case of nondiverging effective interactions between ultrasoft polymer
	chains and derive an exact criterion to determine the topology of
	the phase diagrams of such systems. We use star polymers with a variable
	arm number f as a hybrid system in order to interpolate between these
	two extremes. By deriving an effective interaction between stars
	we can monitor the change in the phase behavior of a system as the
	steepness of the repulsion between its constituent particles increases.
	We also review recent results on the nature and the effects of short-range
	attractions on the phase diagrams of spherical, nonoverlapping colloidal
	particles.},

  abstract = {We review the present status of applications of integral equation
	theories (IETs) for the radial distribution function g(r), to the
	determination of phase diagrams and stability conditions of simple
	and charged classical fluids. After having recalled some basic concepts
	and definitions in the structural description of fluid systems, a
	number of \{IETs\} are examined by reporting the constituting equations
	and solution procedures; these last are discussed also in relationship
	with the actual calculation of coexistence lines and description
	of the critical behavior of each envisaged theory. In this context,
	the crucial role played by the fulfilment of thermodynamic consistency
	in the improvement of the performances of the various approximations,
	is highlighted. Then, a number of results of phase diagram determinations,
	phase stability investigations, and estimates of critical exponents,
	are reported for several neutral and charged model fluids (and their
	mixtures) such as the hard sphere fluid, the square-well fluid, the
	hard-core Yukawa fluid, the Lennard-Jones fluid, and charged hard
	spheres in different regimes of density, sizes and charges. Calculations
	of the phase diagram of a rigid molecule model of \{C60\} are also
	reported. Besides their theoretical interest, these models are investigated
	by many authors also because they can reasonably mimic real systems
	like rare gas liquids, electrolyte solutions, molten salts, neutral
	and charged micellar systems, and colloidal solutions. The related
	experimental evidence is therefore frequently referred, and comparison
	with experimental results is also performed in some case. Theoretical
	results are usually presented in parallel with the available computer
	simulation data, which are extensively quoted both with the aim of
	a systematic assessment of the theories, and in order to offer a
	more complete scenario of phase behavior calculations in classical
	fluids. Perspectives and advantages of future extensions and applications
	of \{IETs\} in different physical contexts in which phase coexistence
	conditions seem worth of a timely investigation, are also discussed.

	a variation of cross-linker in the shell mainly effects the dimensions

	as resulting from an elastic force developed from the swollen shell.
	At temperatures below the core LCST, the core cannot swell to its
	native size (i.e., in the absence of a shell), because the maximum
	expanded shell network prohibits further swelling. Thus, depending

	The structure and morphology of the aggregates was studied by small
	angle neutron scattering varying both the contrast as well as the
	polymer labeling. We found a hierarchy of structures:â The PE component
	crystallizes in lamellar sheets (thickness 40â80 Ã) surrounded
	on both sides by a PEP brush which exhibits a close to parabolic
	density profile. Different aggregates form macroaggregates of needlelike
	shape with the PE lamellar planes in the long direction. This macroaggregation
	is well described by a paracrystalline structure factor. The structural
	parameters depending on composition and molecular weights can be
	well understood in terms of a free energy of formation based on a
	scaling model. A quantitative evaluation of the different contributions
	to the free energy reveals an important role of defect structures
	resulting from the ethylene side branches in the polyethylene component.
	Finally, we show in a semiquantitative approach that the van der
	Waals energy between the brushes is large enough to facilitate macroaggregation.

	(PNiPAM) microgel suspensions has been investigated employing rheology
	and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). A previously described
	model expression for the particle form factor Pinho(q) is extended
	by a model hard sphere structure factor S(q), and the average radial
	density profiles Ï(r) are calculated from the amplitude of the form
	factor A(q) and the structure factor S(q). By this procedure, a direct
	real space description of the spatial ordering in the neighborhood
	of a single particle is obtained. The overall particle size and the
	correlation length Î¾ of the concentration fluctuations of the internal
	polymer network decrease with concentration, revealing the increasing
	compression of the spheres. Thus, the particle form factor Pinho(q)
	of the swollen PNiPAM microgels depends on concentration. The particleâparticle
	interaction potential does not change significantly between 25 and
	32 Â°C. Even approximately 1 K below the lower critical solution
	temperature (LCST), the experimental scattering intensity distributions
	I(q)/c are described very well by the hard sphere structure factor
	when an equivalent hard sphere particle size RHS and volume fraction
	Î·HS are used. Microgels with different degrees of cross-linking
	and particle size resemble true hard sphere behavior up to effective
	volume fractions of Ïeff < 0.35. At higher effective volume fractions
	Ïeff > 0.35 strong deviations from true hard spheres are observed.
	Interpenetration of the outer, less cross-linked regions of the soft
	spheres as well as particle compression occurred at higher concentrations.
	In agreement with this, the equilibrium colloidal phase behavior
	and rheology also has some features of soft sphere systems. At temperatures
	well above the LCST, the interaction potential becomes strongly attractive
	and the collapsed microgel spheres form aggregates consisting of
	flocculated particles without significant long-range order. Hence,
	an attractive interaction potential in concentrated suspensions of
	PNiPAM microgels leads to distinctively different structures as compared
	to attractive hard sphere colloids. When the peculiar structural
	properties of the PNiPAM microgels are considered, they can be used
	as model systems in colloidal science. },

	The potential of this special type of physical contrast variation
	technique is demonstrated with three examples of ferrofluids of different
	particle sizes and viscosities. The dynamics of magnetic moment reorientations
	turned out to be governed by different time scales. For a temperature-dependent
	fraction of individual mobile particles, a frequency-dependent phase
	shift and damping of the intensity modulation have been precisely
	determined and quantitatively explained using a Debye-like relaxation
	model. The characteristic relaxation times, $\tau$, in the liquid
	state of all samples scale with the particle volume and viscosity
	confirming a Brownian-relaxation mechanism. For the remaining fraction
	of particles that form locally ordered domains the orientation distribution
	of the dynamically arrested static moments has been quantified by
	an order parameter $S_1^\textrm{arr}$, which is not accessible with
	nonpolarized neutrons. In a high viscous Co and a magnetite-based
	ferrofluid, $S_1^\textrm{arr}$ corresponds to maximal alignment of
	the static moments in the liquid state and to a gradual decrease
	at lower temperatures when the solvent is frozen. In a low viscosity
	Co-ferrofluid almost no preferred alignment of the arrested particle
	moments was observed. In the magnetite-based ferrofluid with the
	highest dipolar attraction energy an additional phase shift has been
	detected which increases with frequency and magnitude of the magnetic
	field. This indicates clearly that the set-up of local particle ordering
	in distorted hexagonal arrangement is delayed with respect to the

  title = {An analysis of lamellar x-ray diffraction from disordered membrane
	multilayers with application to data from retinal rod},
  journal = {Biophysical Journal},
  year = {1975},
  volume = {15},
  pages = {1201 - 1233},
  abstract = {Oriented multilayers containing a membrane pair within the unit cell
	potentially possess both lattice disorder and substitution disorder.
	Lattice disorder occurs when there is a lack of long-range order
	in the lattice spacings produced by a variation in the nearest neighbor
	distances between unit cells. A simple form of substitution disorder
	can arise from a variation in the separation of the two membranes
	within the unit cells in the multilayer. Lattice disorder produces
	a monotonically increasing width for higher order lamellar "reflections"
	while simple substitution disorder produces an incoherent intensity
	underlying the coherent intensity. A generalized Patterson function
	analysis has been developed for treating lamellar diffraction from
	lattice disordered multilayers. This analysis allows the identification
	of the autocorrelation function of the unit cell electron density
	profile and its subsequent deconvolution to provide the unit cell
	electron density profile. A recursive procedure has been developed
	for separating the incoherent intensity from the coherent intensity
	via a Gaussian probability model of the membrane intra-pair separation.
	In cases studied so far both disorders can be quantitatively accounted
	for and eliminated from interfering with the phasing of the coherent
	intensity or distorting the derived electron density profile. Lamellar
	X-ray diffraction data from intact retinal rods, using either film
	or position sensitive detectors, shows severe effects of both forms
	of disorder which have not been taken into account in past analysis
	of such data. We have applied our analysis to the data on dark adapted
	rod outer segments in electrophysiologically intact retinas of Chabre
	and Cavaggioni (unpublished). An electron density profile is derived
	at 25 A resolution. The lattice nearest neighbor spacing has a variation
	of +/- 19 A out of a 295 A repeat. The intra-unit cell membrane pair
	center to center distance of 88 A varies +/-8 A."},
