	of gyration (Rg) and the hydrodynamic radius (Rh). The two models
	of consideration are (i) the multiply twisted ring system and (ii)
	the daisy-like ring structure. The derivations are made on the basis
	of the Wang?Uhlenbeck theorem on Gaussian distributions for the static
	properties and the Kirkwood?Riseman preaverage approximation for
	the hydrodynamics. The derived particle scattering factors show significant
	differences for the two different ring systems. To distinguish the
	multiply twisted ring system from a linear open chain, it is necessary
	to measure the scattering intensity over a large q range. The daisy-like
	structures resemble star-branched macromolecules but with numbers
	of subrings 4 to 5 times smaller than the arm numbers in a star.
	Differences between the shrinking factors and the ? parameter of
	the various systems are noticeable and can be used to discern these

	X-ray and neutron powder diffraction. The simpler pseudo-Voigt function
	has been used previously to provide an empirical fit to observed

	obtained to make it, to a very good approximation, equivalent to
	a Voigt function, and, additionally, it is described by the half-width
	parameters of the Gaussian and Lorentzian components of that Voigt
	function. This new construction allows for greater flexibility in
	peak-shape description and, in particular, allows for a more straightforward
	convolution of additional functional contributions into the `Voigt'
	component of a peak shape description.},

	as a function of the non-uniformity and the weight average molecular
	weight, and also for various ratios of the statistical segment length
	of the coil to the wave length of the scattered light. The asymptote

	molecular weight distribution (MWD) from a given ZIMM diagram of
	GAUssian coils at the theta point, the corresponding inverse problem
	is solved analytically, the necessary zero approximation of the segment
	length being taken from viscometric measurements. With the help of

	Gang der Polymerisation oder Depolymerisation im Ablaufe folgen kann,
	die dazu benÃ¶tigten Formeln (58), (59) und (61) werden hergeleitet.
	Gleichzeitig wird eine Methode angegeben, mit Hilfe deren man die

  abstract = {The applicability of full-q-range models to fit low-resolution X-ray
	diffraction data from multibilayers exhibiting only weak quasi-Bragg
	peak scattering has been analysed. The models consider different
	structure factors, accounting for different types of lattice disorder
	caused by stacking faults or bending fluctuations. Numerical tests
	of the models, considering instrumental influence of a line-focus
	collimation system, demonstrated that Bragg peak line shapes given
	by different lattice disorders cannot be discerned. However, line-shape
	parameters can be determined for a particular sample, if the type
	of disorder is known a priori. This has been verified by comparing
	the experimental results for the fluctuation parameter of palmitoyl-oleoyl
	phosphatidylcholine (POPC) as a function of temperature with high-resolution
	data on the same lipid. Tests further show that the calculation of
	structural parameters, such as the membrane thickness or the extent
	of the interbilayer water region, is not obscured by the smearing
	imposed by the instrument. The model was further applied successfully
	to experimental data of lipid mixtures composed of sphingomyelin
	(SM)/POPC/cholesterol and dipalmitoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (DPPE)/dipalmitoyl
	phosphatidylglycerol (DPPG). The structural parameters determined
	give valuable insight into the physical state of the membrane system,
	which is not accessible when quasi-Bragg reflections only are considered.},

  pages = {1201 - 1233},
  abstract = {Oriented multilayers containing a membrane pair within the unit cell
	potentially possess both lattice disorder and substitution disorder.
	Lattice disorder occurs when there is a lack of long-range order
	in the lattice spacings produced by a variation in the nearest neighbor
	distances between unit cells. A simple form of substitution disorder
	can arise from a variation in the separation of the two membranes
	within the unit cells in the multilayer. Lattice disorder produces
	a monotonically increasing width for higher order lamellar "reflections"
	while simple substitution disorder produces an incoherent intensity
	underlying the coherent intensity. A generalized Patterson function
	analysis has been developed for treating lamellar diffraction from
	lattice disordered multilayers. This analysis allows the identification
	of the autocorrelation function of the unit cell electron density
	profile and its subsequent deconvolution to provide the unit cell
	electron density profile. A recursive procedure has been developed
	for separating the incoherent intensity from the coherent intensity
	via a Gaussian probability model of the membrane intra-pair separation.
	In cases studied so far both disorders can be quantitatively accounted
	for and eliminated from interfering with the phasing of the coherent
	intensity or distorting the derived electron density profile. Lamellar
	X-ray diffraction data from intact retinal rods, using either film
	or position sensitive detectors, shows severe effects of both forms
	of disorder which have not been taken into account in past analysis
	of such data. We have applied our analysis to the data on dark adapted
	rod outer segments in electrophysiologically intact retinas of Chabre
	and Cavaggioni (unpublished). An electron density profile is derived
	at 25 A resolution. The lattice nearest neighbor spacing has a variation
	of +/- 19 A out of a 295 A repeat. The intra-unit cell membrane pair
	center to center distance of 88 A varies +/-8 A."},

  abstract = { The structure of concentrated temperature-sensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide)
	(PNiPAM) microgel suspensions has been investigated employing rheology
	and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). A previously described
	model expression for the particle form factor Pinho(q) is extended
	by a model hard sphere structure factor S(q), and the average radial
	density profiles Ï†(r) are calculated from the amplitude of the form
	factor A(q) and the structure factor S(q). By this procedure, a direct
	real space description of the spatial ordering in the neighborhood
	of a single particle is obtained. The overall particle size and the
	correlation length Î¾ of the concentration fluctuations of the internal
	polymer network decrease with concentration, revealing the increasing
	compression of the spheres. Thus, the particle form factor Pinho(q)
	of the swollen PNiPAM microgels depends on concentration. The particleâˆ’particle
	interaction potential does not change significantly between 25 and
	32 Â°C. Even approximately 1 K below the lower critical solution
	temperature (LCST), the experimental scattering intensity distributions
	I(q)/c are described very well by the hard sphere structure factor
	when an equivalent hard sphere particle size RHS and volume fraction
	Î·HS are used. Microgels with different degrees of cross-linking
	and particle size resemble true hard sphere behavior up to effective
	volume fractions of Ï†eff < 0.35. At higher effective volume fractions
	Ï†eff > 0.35 strong deviations from true hard spheres are observed.
	Interpenetration of the outer, less cross-linked regions of the soft
	spheres as well as particle compression occurred at higher concentrations.
	In agreement with this, the equilibrium colloidal phase behavior
	and rheology also has some features of soft sphere systems. At temperatures
	well above the LCST, the interaction potential becomes strongly attractive
	and the collapsed microgel spheres form aggregates consisting of
	flocculated particles without significant long-range order. Hence,
	an attractive interaction potential in concentrated suspensions of
	PNiPAM microgels leads to distinctively different structures as compared
	to attractive hard sphere colloids. When the peculiar structural
	properties of the PNiPAM microgels are considered, they can be used
	as model systems in colloidal science. },
