\chapter{Analytical Solutions for Structure factors}
\label{sec:structurefactor}
The different types of structure factors can be selected in the
different submenus. Next top traditional structure factors also
some functions, which are not structure factors
at all have been implemented for some other purposes.

\section{Methods to include structure factors}
For each scattering object $i$ next to a size distribution $N_i(x;\B{l}_i)$ also a
structure factor $S_i(Q;\B{s}_i)$ can be included. When a structure factor is included
several theoretical ways to account for it have been implemented
like the monodisperse approximation (\ref{sec:SQmonodisperse}),
decoupling approach (\ref{sec:SQdecoupling}),
local monodisperse approximation (\ref{sec:SQlocalmonodisperse}),
partial structure factor (\ref{sec:SQpartial})
and scaling approximation of partial structure factors (\ref{sec:SQscaling}).
At the moment it is assumed that there are no interactions between different species
of scatterers so that the total scattering is given by the sum of the scattering of the
individual species
\BE
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(Q) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q)
\EE
whereby different approaches to include structure factor effects in
the differential scattering cross-sections $\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q)$
of the species $i$ of scatterer are defined below.

\subsection{Monodisperse approach}
\label{sec:SQmonodisperse}
~\\

The monodisperse approach is the simplest way to include a structure factor in the analysis.
This approach simply multiplies the size averaged form factor with the structure factor.
Here it is assumed that the interaction potential between particles are spherical symmetric
and independent of the particle size.

\BE \frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) = \left[
\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i)
F_i^2(Q;\B{a}_i,x) dx \right] S_i(Q;\B{s}_i)
\EE

\subsection{Decoupling approximation}
\label{sec:SQdecoupling}
~\\

For systems with small polydispersities and small anisotropies leads to a
decoupling approach of Kotlarchyk and Chen \cite{Kotlarchyk1983}. It is assumed that interactions
are independent of particle size and orientation.
%\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) = &
\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i) F_i^2(Q;\B{a}_i,x) dx
+  \frac{1}{n_i}\left[\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i)
F_i(Q;\B{a}_i,x) dx\right]^2  \nonumber \\
\times & \left[S_i(Q;\B{s}_i)-1\right]
\end{align}
with
\BE
n_i = \int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i)  dx.
\label{eq:ni}
\EE

The decoupling approximation can only be combined with those form factor,
for which the scattering amplitude $F_i(Q;\B{a}_i,x)$ has been implemented.
However, for many form factors only the scattering intensity $F_i^2(Q;\B{a}_i,x)$ is
available. The combination of those form factors with the decoupling approach produces
an error message in \SASfit.



\subsection{Local monodisperse approximation}
\label{sec:SQlocalmonodisperse}
~\\

The opposite limit of the approximations as used for the
decoupling approximation is used in the local monodisperse
approximation \cite{Pedersen1994}. In this approach it is assumed
that a particle of a certain size is always surrounded by
particles with the same size. Following this the scattering is
approximated by that of monodisperse sub-systems weighted by the
size distribution:
\BE
\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) =
\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i)
F_i^2(Q;\B{a}_i,x) S_i(Q;\B{s}_i,R_i(\B{a}_i,x)) dx
\EE
in which it has been indicated that the structure factor is for particles of size
$R_i(\B{a}_i,x)$. As the distribution $N_i(x;\B{l}_i)$ does not necessarily describe the
distribution of the overall size. \SASfit assumes, that the radius of a particle
with the form factor $F_i(Q;\B{a}_i,x)$ used in the structure factor is given
by the radius of a sphere with the same volume $V_i(\B{a}_i,x)$
\BE
R_i(\B{a}_i,x) = \oldsqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4 \pi}V_i(\B{a}_i,x)}.
\label{eq:Ri}
\EE
This local monodisperse approximation works better than the decoupling approximation for
systems with larger polydispersities and higher concentrations. As
compared to the decoupling approximation and the scaling
approximation described below, it has the advantage that the cross
section is linear in the size distribution.

\subsection{partial structure factors}
\label{sec:SQpartial}
~\\

For polydisperse systems it is also not possible to write the scattering cross section as a
product of a form factor and a structure factor. The scattering cross section has the form
%\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) =
&\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i) F_i^2(Q;\B{a}_i,x) dx \\
+ & \frac{1}{n_i}\int_0^\infty\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i)N_i(x';\B{l}_i)F_i(Q;\B{a}_i,x)F_i(Q;\B{a}_i,x') \nonumber \\
\times & \left[S_i(Q;\B{s}_i,R_i(\B{a}_i,x),R_i(\B{a}_i,x'))-1\right] dx dx' \nonumber
\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
where monodisperse structure factor $S_i(Q;\B{s}_i,\dots)$
is evaluated for the radius
$(R_i(\B{a}_i,x)+R_i(\B{a}_i,x'))/2$. $n_i$ and $R_i(\B{a}_i,x)$ have the same
definition as those in eq.\ \ref{eq:ni} and \ref{eq:Ri}.

\subsection{Scaling approximation}
\label{sec:SQscaling}
~\\

A scaling approximation has recently been introduced by Gazzillo
et al. \cite{Gazzillo1999}. It is assumed that the pair correlation functions
are identical except for a scaling constant. This leads to the
following expression:
%\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) =
 &\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i) F_i^2(Q;\B{a}_i,x) dx \\
+ & \frac{1}{n_i}\int_0^\infty\int_0^\infty
N_i(x;\B{l}_i) N_i(x';\B{l}_i) F_i(Q;\B{a}_i,x) F_i(Q;\B{a}_i,x') \nonumber \\
\times & \frac{\overline{V}_i(\B{a}_i,x,x')}{V_{i,av}}
\left[S_i(Q;\B{s}_i,R_i(\B{a}_i,x),R_i(\B{a}_i,x'))-1\right] \;dx
dx' \nonumber
\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
where $V_{i,av}$ is given by
\BE
V_{i,av} = \frac{\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i) V_i(\B{a}_i,x) dx}{\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i) dx}
\EE
and $V_i(\B{a}_i,x,x')$ by
\BE
\overline{V}_i(\B{a}_i,x,x') = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\oldsqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4\pi}V_i(\B{a}_i,x)}+\oldsqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4\pi}V_i(\B{a}_i,x')}\right)\right)^3
\EE
and the monodisperse structure factor is evaluated for the radius
$(R_i(\B{a}_i,x)+R_i(\B{a}_i,x'))/2$. $n_i$ and $R_i(\B{a}_i,x)$ have the same
definition as those in eq.\ \ref{eq:ni} and \ref{eq:Ri}.

Note that the expression is not linear in the size distribution
and that it involves double integrations, which makes least-square
fitting with this expression relatively slow.

\subsection{van der Waals one-fluid approximation}
\label{sec:SQvdW1}
~\\
This approximation is similar to the scaling approximation introduced by Gazzillo
et al. \cite{Gazzillo1999}. The exact formula is given by
%\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) =
 &\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i) F_i^2(Q;\B{a}_i,x) dx \\
+ & \frac{1}{n_i}\int_0^\infty\int_0^\infty
N_i(x;\B{l}_i) N_i(x';\B{l}_i) F_i(Q;\B{a}_i,x) F_i(Q;\B{a}_i,x') \nonumber \\
\times & \frac{\overline{V}_i(\B{a}_i,x,x')}{V_{i,x}}
\left[S_i(Q;\B{s}_i,R_i(\B{a}_i,x),R_i(\B{a}_i,x'))-1\right] \;dx
dx' \nonumber
\end{align}
%\end{subequations}
where $V_{i,x}$ is given by
\BE
V_{i,av} = \frac{\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i) V_i(\B{a}_i,x) dx}{\int_0^\infty N_i(x;\B{l}_i) dx}
\EE
and $V_i(\B{a}_i,x,x')$ by
\BE
\overline{V}_i(\B{a}_i,x,x') = \frac{4}{3}\pi \left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\oldsqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4\pi}V_i(\B{a}_i,x)}+\oldsqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4\pi}V_i(\B{a}_i,x')}\right)\right)^3
\EE
and the monodisperse structure factor is evaluated for the radius
$(R_i(\B{a}_i,x)+R_i(\B{a}_i,x'))/2$. $n_i$ and $R_i(\B{a}_i,x)$ have the same
definition as those in eq.\ \ref{eq:ni} and \ref{eq:Ri}.

Note that the expression is not linear in the size distribution
and that it involves double integrations, which makes least-square
fitting with this expression relatively slow.

In Baxter's model \cite{Baxter1968,Robertus1989,Kruif1989,Barboy1974,Menon1991,Menon1991a}
of adhesive hard spheres the pair interaction potential $U(r)$ is replaced by
\begin{equation}
\frac{U(r)}{k_BT} =
 \begin{cases}
      \infty    & \text{for} \quad 0<r<\sigma \\

      0         & \text{for} \quad r>\sigma+\Delta
   \end{cases}

$\tau$, characterizes the adhesive strength.

\section{Multi Lamellar Structures}
\subsection{Multi-Lamellar Structures, Thermal Disorder} \hspace{1pt}\\

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{ThermalDisorderSQ.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Thermal disorder, considering fluctuations of flat layers
around well defined and evenly spaced equilibrium positions.}
\label{ThermalDisorderSQ}
\end{figure}

The first type describes thermal disorder (TD) caused by small
fluctuations of the bilayers around well defined mean layer
positions of equal separation (Fig. \ref{ThermalDisorderSQ}) \cite{Pabst2003,Fruhwirth2004}. In
such a crystal lattice the long-range order is preserved and the
structure factor for a single domain of size $L = Nd$ is identical
to that of a perfect finite crystal multiplied by the well known
Debye-Waller temperature factor, where $\Delta = \left<
(d_k-d)^2\right>$ denotes the mean square fluctuations of the
bilayers. As shown in Fig. \ref{ThermalDisorderSQ},
$S_\text{TD}(Q)$ is characterized by a set of Bragg peaks of equal
width, the diffraction order amplitudes of which decrease
exponentially with the Debye-Waller factor. The lost intensity is
found as a diffuse background scattering, which increases to the
limit of $N$ for large $Q$.
\begin{align}
S_\text{TD}(Q,N,d,\Delta,N_\text{diff}) = N_\text{diff} + \sum_{N_k=N-2\sigma}^{N+2\sigma} x_k
S_\text{k,TD}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
S_\text{k,TD} & = \left( N_k + 2 \exp\left(
-\frac{Q^2\Delta^2}{2}\right) \sum_{m=1}^{N_k-1} (N_k-m) \cos(mQd)
\right)
\end{align}
$N_\text{diff}$ accounts for an additional
diffuse background, due to a number of uncorrelated
scattering bilayers in $S_\text{TD}(Q,N,d,\Delta,N_\text{diff})$,
which is not included in the TD theory.
Its origin is attributed to bilayers with strong lattice defects or
unilamellar vesicles, which display neither short-range nor
(quasi-) long-range order.

The structure factors $S_\text{k,TD}(Q)$ with low, but fixed
stacking numbers $N$ show oscillations at low $Q$ (as can be seen in
Fig. \ref{ThermalDisorderSQ}), but no such oscillations are found in
experimental data. This can be understood as the consequence of
polydispersity in the size of the different stacks. In order to
eliminate these artifacts from strictly monodisperse systems, we use
a `polydisperse' structure factor, i.e. we use an average of a
series of structure factors with varying numbers of bilayers
\cite{Fruhwirth2004}. The analytical form of the distribution is not
known a priori. We use a Gaussian distribution approximated by a
discrete series The standard deviation $\sigma$ for the
Gaussian-weighted distribution is chosen as
\begin{align}
\sigma =
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{N} & \text{for} N\geq 5 \text{,} \\
0.5(N-1) & \text{for} N< 5
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Therefore, $N$ must be greater or equal to 2, which is a
reasonable restriction for multilamellar stacks of bilayers. In
the range of $N \pm 2\sigma$, structure factors weighted by
\begin{align}
x_k & = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left[
-\frac{(N_k-N)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]
\end{align}
are calculated, where $N$ is the mean number of stacks and $N_k$
is one of the  bilayers in the range $N\pm 2\sigma$. This
polydispersity model does not introduce new free parameters and is
symmetrical around the mean $N$.

\caption{Stacking disorder as described within paracrystalline
theory (PT) is due to displacements from the mean layer
positions.} \label{ParacrystallineTheorySQ}
\end{figure}


The second type of disorder accounts for the presence of small
variations in the bilayer separations (Fig.
\ref{ParacrystallineTheorySQ}), so-called stacking disorder, and is
described within the paracrystalline theory (PT)
\cite{Hosemann1962,Guinier1963,Blaurock1982,Pabst2003,Fruhwirth2004}. As the position of an
individual fluctuating layer in a paracrystal is determined solely
by its nearestneighbour membranes, the crystalline long-range order
is lost. Still, we are able to observe Bragg-peak scattering due to
the fact that there is quasi long-range order. However, these
quasi-Bragg peaks will display a typical line shape. In the case of
disorder of the second kind, the structure factor derived from
paracrystalline theory is given by \cite{Guinier1963}
\begin{align}
S_\text{PT}(Q,N,d,\Delta,N_\text{diff}+) = N_\text{diff}+\sum_{N_k=N-2\sigma}^{N+2\sigma} x_k
S_\text{k,PT}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
S_\text{k,PT} &= \left( N_k + 2 \sum_{m=1}^{N_k-1} (N_k-m)
\cos(mQd) \exp\left( -\frac{m^2Q^2\Delta^2}{2}\right) \right)
\end{align}
$N_\text{diff}$ accounts for an additional
diffuse background, due to a number of uncorrelated
scattering bilayers in $S_\text{PT}(Q,N,d,\Delta,N_\text{diff})$,
which is not included in the paracrystalline theory.
Its origin is attributed to bilayers with strong lattice defects or
unilamellar vesicles, which display neither short-range nor
(quasi-) long-range order.

Fig. \ref{ParacrystallineTheorySQ} shows that the quasi-Bragg peak
intensity decreases for $S_\text{PT}(Q)$, as in the previous case of
thermal disorder. However, the decrease in peak height is also
accompanied by a progressive broadening proportional to the square
of the diffraction order $h$ \cite{Schwartz1975}. The line shape of
the tails is essentially Lorentzian with
$$S_\text{k,PT}(Q) \propto (Q - Q_h)^2,$$
where $Q_h$ is the position of the $h^\text{th}$ diffraction order
in $Q$ space. Again, the loss in intensity shows up as diffuse
background scattering, which is stronger than from pure thermal
disorder.


The structure factors $S_\text{k,PT}(Q)$ with low, but fixed
stacking numbers $N$ show oscillations at low $Q$ (as can be seen in
Fig. \ref{ParacrystallineTheorySQ}), but no such oscillations are
found in experimental data. This can be understood as the
consequence of polydispersity in the size of the different stacks.
In order to eliminate these artifacts from strictly monodisperse
systems, we use a `polydisperse' structure factor, i.e. we use an
average of a series of structure factors with varying numbers of
bilayers \cite{Fruhwirth2004}. The analytical form of the
distribution is not known a priori. We use a Gaussian distribution
approximated by a discrete series The standard deviation $\sigma$
for the Gaussian-weighted distribution is chosen as
\begin{align}
\sigma =
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{N} & \text{for} N\geq 5 \text{,} \\
0.5(N-1) & \text{for} N< 5
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Therefore, $N$ must be greater or equal to 2, which is a
reasonable restriction for multilamellar stacks of bilayers. In
the range of $N \pm 2\sigma$, structure factors weighted by
\begin{align}
x_k & = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left[
-\frac{(N_k-N)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]
\end{align}
are calculated, where $N$ is the mean number of stacks and $N_k$
is one of the  bilayers in the range $N\pm 2\sigma$. This
polydispersity model does not introduce new free parameters and is
symmetrical around the mean $N$.

\caption{Bending fluctuation disorder is a particular feature of
the $L_\alpha$ (smectic A) phase and is caused by bilayer
undulations. The particular shape of the Bragg peaks is given by
the modified Caill\'e theory (MCT).}
\label{ModifiedCailleTheorySQ}
\end{figure}

There is another type of disorder when bilayer bending fluctuations
are considered (Fig. \ref{ModifiedCailleTheorySQ}) \cite{Pabst2003,Fruhwirth2004}. Such
fluctuations are particularly pronounced in the fluid $L_\alpha$
phase (equivalent to smectic A). Caill\'e Bending fluctuation
disorder is a particular feature of the $L_\alpha$ (smectic A) phase
and is caused by bilayer undulations. The particular shape of the
Bragg peaks is given by the modified Caill\'e theory (MCT).
\cite{Caille1972} realized the impact on the structure factor, which
in a modified version \cite{Zhang1994} of the Caill\'e theory (MCT)
is
\begin{align}
S_\text{MC}(Q,N,d,\eta_1,\gamma, N_\text{diff}) = N_\text{diff}+
\sum_{N_k=N-2\sigma}^{N+2\sigma} x_k S_\text{k,MC}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
S_\text{k,MC} = N_k + 2 \sum_{m=1}^{N_k-1} (N_k-m) \cos(mQd) \,\,
e^{ -\left(\frac{d}{2\pi}\right)^2 Q^2 \eta_1 \gamma } \,\, (\pi
m)^{-(d/2\pi)^2Q^2\eta_1}
\end{align}
Here, $\gamma$ is Euler's constant and
$$ \eta = \pi k_B T / 2d^2(BK_c)^{1/2}$$
is the Caill\'e parameter, which is a measure for the bilayer
fluctuations and is inversely proportional to the square root of the
bilayer bending rigidity $K_c$ times the bulk modulus of compression
$B$ (De Gennes \& Prost, 1993). Therefore, a lineshape analysis of
the quasi-Bragg peaks opens an important experimental window on
interbilayer interactions. Further, $K_c$ and $B$ can be decoupled
as demonstrated recently by hydration studies
\cite{Petrache1998,Pabst2003}, or more elegantly by measuring
multibilayers aligned on a solid substrate \cite{Lyatskaya2000}.
$N_\text{diff}$ accounts for an additional diffuse background, due
to a number of uncorrelated scattering bilayers in
$S_\text{MC}(Q,N,d,\eta_1,\gamma, N_\text{diff}) $, which is not
included in the MCT. Its origin is attributed to bilayers with
strong lattice defects or unilamellar vesicles, which display
neither short-range nor (quasi-) long-range order.

Fig. \ref{ModifiedCailleTheorySQ} shows a typical example of
$S_\text{k,MCT}(Q)$, which is similar to $S_\text{PT}(Q)$ with
respect to the progressive decrease in peak height and increase in
peak width, but which differs significantly in line shape as
$$
S_\text{k,MCT} \propto (Q-Q_h)^{-1+\eta h^2}
$$
for randomly oriented scattering domains \cite{Roux1988,Zhang1994}.


The structure factors $S_\text{k,MCT}(Q)$ with low, but fixed
stacking numbers $N$ show oscillations at low $Q$ (as can be seen in
Fig. \ref{ModifiedCailleTheorySQ}), but no such oscillations are
found in experimental data. This can be understood as the
consequence of polydispersity in the size of the different stacks.
In order to eliminate these artifacts from strictly monodisperse
systems, we use a `polydisperse' structure factor, i.e. we use an
average of a series of structure factors with varying numbers of
bilayers \cite{Fruhwirth2004}. The analytical form of the
distribution is not known a priori. We use a Gaussian distribution
approximated by a discrete series The standard deviation $\sigma$
for the Gaussian-weighted distribution is chosen as
\begin{align}
\sigma =
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{N} & \text{for} N\geq 5 \text{,} \\
0.5(N-1) & \text{for} N< 5
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Therefore, $N$ must be greater or equal to 2, which is a
reasonable restriction for multilamellar stacks of bilayers. In
the range of $N \pm 2\sigma$, structure factors weighted by
\begin{align}
x_k & = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left[
-\frac{(N_k-N)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]
\end{align}
are calculated, where $N$ is the mean number of stacks and $N_k$
is one of the  bilayers in the range $N\pm 2\sigma$. This
polydispersity model does not introduce new free parameters and is
symmetrical around the mean $N$.

\section{Mass Fractal}~\\
\label{sect:SQ4clusteraggregates}
For a fractal object, the structure factor $S(q)$ can be calculated
\cite{Sorensen1999,Sorensen1992} via
the pair correlation function $g(r)$, which describes the total number of
particles within a sphere of radius $r$ centered in a central
particle and is given (for $\dim = 3$) by
\begin{align}
N(r) = \Phi \int_0^r g(r) \, 4\pi r^2 \, dr
\end{align}
or
\begin{align}
\textrm{d}N(r) = \Phi  g(r) \, 4\pi r^2 \, dr \label{eq:fractdN}
\end{align}
On the other hand, a fractal object is characterized by a spatial
distribution of the individual scatterers given by
\begin{align}
N(r) = \left( \frac{r}{r_0} \right)^D \label{eq:fractN}
\end{align}
where $r_0$ is the gauge of the measurement, which has
the magnitude of the characteristic dimension of each
individual scatterer.
Differentiation of \ref{eq:fractN} and identification with \ref{eq:fractdN}
gives
\begin{align}
\Phi g(r) = \frac{D}{4\pi r_0^D} r^{D-3}
\end{align}
Because $D$ is smaller than 3, $g(r)$ goes to zero at
large $r$. This is clearly unphysical.
At some large scale, the sample will show a
macroscopic density. A good knowledge of the sample
allows in general a reasonable assumption for the
large-scale behavior of $g(r)$. Therefore a cut-off function
$h(r,\xi)$ has to be introduced, where $\xi$ is a cut-off distance, to
describe the behavior of the pair correlation function
at large distances. To derive the analytical form of
$S(q)$ within this assumption, one can use the general
theory of liquids, where the uniform density is subtracted
to avoid a divergence in the evaluation of $S(q)$.
We then write
\begin{align}
4\pi\Phi[g(r)-1] = \frac{D}{r_0^D} \, r^{D-3} h(r,\xi)
\label{eq:fract_g(r)-1}
\end{align}
The meaning of $\xi$ is only qualitative and has to be
made precise in any particular situation. Generally
speaking, it represents the characteristic distance
above which the mass distribution in the sample is no
longer described by the fractal law. In practice, it can
represent the size of an aggregate or a correlation
length in a disordered material.
For isotropic systems
\begin{align}
S(q) = 1+4\pi\Phi\int_0^\infty [g(r)-1] \frac{\sin(qr)}{qr} \, r^2 \, dr
\end{align}
Combined with \ref{eq:fract_g(r)-1} one gets
\begin{align}
S(q) = 1 +\frac{D}{r_0^D} \int_0^\infty r^{D-3} h(r,\xi)  \frac{\sin(qr)}{qr}\, r^2 \, dr
\label{eq:hSQ}
\end{align}
Several cut-off functions $h(r,\xi)$ have been discussed in the
literature and compared by Sorensen et al.\
\cite{Sorensen1999,Sorensen1992}.
\begin{align}
h_\text{Exp}(r,\xi)     &= \exp\left[-\tfrac{r}{\xi}\right] \label{eq:hExp}\\
h_\text{Gauss}(r,\xi)   &= \exp\left[-\left(\tfrac{r}{\xi}\right)^2\right] \label{eq:hGauss}\\
h_\text{Exp(-x$\hat{~}$a)}(r,\xi,\alpha,D) &= \exp\left[-\left(\tfrac{r}{\xi}\right)^\alpha\right] \label{eq:hExpmxa}\\
h_\text{OverlapSph}(r,\xi)   &=
\begin{cases}
%\left(\frac{4}{3}\pi\xi\right)
\left(1+\frac{r}{4\xi}\right)\left(1-\frac{r}{2\xi}\right)^2
& \text{for } r\leq 2\xi \\
0 & \text{for } r>2\xi
\end{cases}
\label{eq:hOverlapSph}
\end{align}
For the cut-off functions \ref{eq:hExp} and \ref{eq:hGauss} the integral \ref{eq:hSQ} can be solved
analytically and the corresponding structure factors are given by
\begin{align}
S_\text{Exp}(q,\xi,D,r_0) &= 1 +  \cfrac{D \Gamma(D-1)
\sin\left([D-1]\arctan(q \xi)\right)}{\left( q r_0\right)^D
\left[1+\tfrac{1}{q^2\xi^2}\right]^{(D-1)/2}} \\
S_\text{Gauss}(q,\xi,D,r_0) &= 1 +
    \Gamma\left[\tfrac{D}{2}\right]\frac{D}{2}
    \left(\frac{\xi}{r_0}\right)^D
    {}_1F_1\left[\tfrac{D}{2},\tfrac{3}{2},-\tfrac{q^2\xi^2}{8}\right]
\end{align}
where $D$ is the fractal dimension, $\xi$ is a cut-off length for
the fractal correlations, $\Gamma(x)$ is the gamma function.
${}_1F_1\left[\right]$ is the Kummer or hypergeometric function. For
the cut-off functions \ref{eq:hExpmxa} and \ref{eq:hOverlapSph} the
integral \ref{eq:hSQ} is solved numerically.

This is the structure factor for a system of charged, spheroidal objects in a dielectric
medium. When
combined with an appropriate form factor (such as sphere, core+shell, ellipsoid etc.),
this allows for inclusion of the interparticle interference effects due to screened
coulomb repulsion between charged particles.
The salt concentration, is used to compute the ionic strength of the solution which
in turn is used to compute the Debye screening length. At present there is no provision
for entering the ionic strength directly nor for use of any multivalent salts. The
counterions are also assumed to be monovalent.

\subsection{Voigt Peak} ~\\

In spectroscopy, the Voigt profile is a spectral line profile
named after Woldemar Voigt and found in all branches of
spectroscopy in which a spectral line is broadened by two types of
mechanisms, one of which alone would produce a Doppler profile,
and the other of which would produce a Lorentzian profile. All
normalized line profiles can be considered to be probability
distributions. The Doppler profile is essentially a normal
distribution and a Lorentzian profile is essentially a Cauchy
distribution. Without loss of generality, we can consider only
centered profiles which peak at zero. The Voigt profile is then
the convolution of a Lorentzian profile and a Doppler profile:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
V(x\vert\sigma,\gamma)& = \int_\infty^\infty D(x'\vert\sigma) \,
                                            L(x-x'\vert\gamma)\, dx'
\end{align}
where $x$ is frequency from line center, $D(x\vert\sigma)$ is the
centered Doppler profile:
\begin{align}
D(x\vert\sigma) & = \frac{e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2}}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}
\end{align}
and $L(x\vert\gamma)$ is the centered Lorentzian profile:
\begin{align}
L(x\vert\gamma) & = \frac{\gamma}{\pi(x^2+\gamma^2)} .
\end{align}
The defining integral can be evaluated as:
\begin{align}
V(x) & = \frac{\Re[w(z)]}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}
\end{align}
where $\Re[w(z)]$ is the real part of the complex error function
of $z$ and
\begin{align}
z = \frac{x+i\gamma}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
S_{\text{Voigt}}(Q,Q_m,A,\sigma,\gamma,c_0) = A \,\,
V(Q-Q_m\vert\sigma,\gamma)+c_0
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
