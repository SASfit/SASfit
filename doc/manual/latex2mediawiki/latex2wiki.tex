\title[SASfit]{{\tt SASfit}: A program for fitting simple
 structural models to small angle scattering data}
\date{\today}
\begin{abstract}
{\tt SASfit} has been written for analyzing and plotting small angle
scattering data. It can calculate integral structural parameters
like radius of gyration, scattering invariant, Porod constant.
Furthermore it can fit size distributions together with several form
factors including different structure factors. Additionally an
algorithm has been implemented, which allows to simultaneously fit
several scattering curves with a common set of (global) parameters.
This last option is especially important in contrast variation
experiments or measurements with polarised neutrons. The global fit
helps to determine fit parameters unambiguously which by analyzing a
single curve would be otherwise strongly correlated. The program has
been written to fulfill the needs at the small angle neutron
scattering facility at PSI (\url{http://kur.web.psi.ch}). The
numerical routines have been written in C whereas the menu interface
has been written in tcl/tk and the plotting routine with the
extension blt. The newest {\tt SASfit} version can be downloaded
from \url{http://kur.web.psi.ch/sans1/SANSSoft/sasfit.html}.

\chapter{Introduction to the data analysis program {\tt SASfit }}

Small-angle scattering (SAS) is one of the powerful techniques to
investigate the structure of materials on a mesoscopic length scale
(10 - 10000 {\AA}). It is used to study the shapes and sizes of the
particles dispersed in a homogenous medium. The materials could be a
macromolecule (biological molecule, polymer, micelle, etc) in a
solvent, a precipitate of material A in a matrix of another material
B, a microvoid in certain metal or a magnetic inhomogeneity in a
nonmoagnetic material. This technique is also used to study the
spatial distribution of particles in a medium, thus providing the
information about the inter-particle interactions. The small angle
scattering methods includes small angle neutron, x-ray or light
scattering. The type of samples that can be studied by scattering
techniques, the sample environment that can be applied, the actual
length scale probed and the information that can be obtained, all
depend on the nature of the radiation employed. The advantage of
small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) over other SAS methods is the
deuteration method. This consists in using deuterium labeled
components in the sample in order to enhance their contrast. Whereas
SANS has disadvantaged over small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) by
the intrinsically low flux of neutron sources compared to the orders
of magnitude higher fluxes of x-ray sources. Neutron scattering in
general is sensitive to fluctuations in the density of nuclei in the
sample. X-ray scattering is sensitive to inhomogeneities in electron
densities whereas light scattering is sensitive to fluctuations in
polarizability (refractive index). In general, irrespective of the
type of radiation, they also share several similarities. Perhaps the
most important of these is the fact that, with minor adjustments to
account for the different types of radiation, the same basic
equations and laws can be used to analyze data from these
techniques. The small-angle scattering data can contain information
concerning both the structure and interaction within the sytem. This
information can be obtained by either performing model-independent
analysis or detailed model dependent analysis. {\tt SASfit } is such a
software package built for analysis of small-angle neutron
scattering data concerning soft matter. The main emphasis of the
software is to provide easy to use visual interface for the new as
well as for an expert user. The software package contains most of
the tools to treat large range of scientific problems and large
volume of data produced on a SAS instrument. It allows users to
derive useful information from the SAS scattering data.

\section{System Requirements And Software Installation}
{\tt SASfit} is a program for analyzing small angle scattering data.
The numerical fitting routines are written in C and the menu
interface in {\tt tcl/tk}. For the plotting of the data the {\tt
tcl} extension {\tt blt} has been used. The last version 0.85 of
{\tt SASfit} has been tested with the {\tt tcl/tk} version 8.3 and
the {\tt blt} version 2.4s. \\

\noindent
{\tt SASfit } is available for users analysing data taken at PSI. \\
{\tt SASfit } has been developed at the Paul Scherrer Institute (PSI) and remains \copyright\ of PSI. \\
{\tt SASfit } is provided to users of the PSI facilities.\\
{\tt SASfit } is provided "as is", and with no warranty. \\

\subsection{Installation Procedure} ~\\

\verb"SASfit" has has been compiled with tcl/tk 8.4 and Blt 2.4. To

\section{User Interface Window}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
  \subfigure[main window]{\label{fig:QTmainA}\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{QTmainA.png}}
  \subfigure[popup menu]{\label{fig:QTmainB}\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{QTmainB.png}}
\caption{Main {\tt SASfit } graphical user interface window}
\label{fig:QTmain}
\end{figure}
\sloppy
The core {\tt SASfit } window consists of various tabs (shown in the oval
marking in the figure \ref{fig:QTmain}(a), they are "\texttt{fit of single data set}",
"\texttt{multiple data sets for global fitting}", "\texttt{residuum}", "\texttt{size
distrib.}", "\texttt{integral structural parameters}", "\texttt{parameters of
analytical size distrib.}", "\texttt{moments of analytical size
distrib.}", and "\texttt{2D detector intensity}" as shown in the red oval
selection. The tabs for single data set and multiple data sets are used to
plot single or multiple data files and view the plotted graphs along
with the operations to perform during fitting. Residuum shows the
difference between the experimental and theoretical fits. Size
distributions give the plotted view of the number density v/s radius
of the particle. Integral structural parameters are obtained using
model independent fitting, such as Guinier approximation, Porod law
etc. Parameters of analytical size distributions provides with
details of size distributions used and the numbers obtained, whereas
moments of analytical size distribution shows the contribution of
scattering from different size distribution. The final tab 2D
detector intensity is used in case of anisotropic scattering data.
The window were the graphs are generated has options of printing the
graph plotted view, copying the data in the ASCII format or as an
image (wmf) format for further processing or presenting (figure
\ref{fig:QTmain}(b)). {\tt SASfit } accepts the isotropic data in the ASCII
format. The data can be imported as a single data set or for
multiple data sets (several scattering curves).

\section{Importing data files for a single data set}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{QTloadingSingleDS.png}
\caption{Menu interface for input single data set}
\label{fig:QTloadingSingleDS}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
  \subfigure[Path and format selection for new file]{\label{fig:QTNewFile}
             \includegraphics[width=0.44\textwidth]{QTNewFile.png}}
  \subfigure[Selecting the format columns of the file]{\label{fig:QTascii1}
             \includegraphics[width=0.22\textwidth]{QTascii1.png}
             \includegraphics[width=0.22\textwidth]{QTascii2.png}}
\caption{Importing single data sets} \label{fig:QTNewFileDS}
\end{figure}

The single data set option allows the user to perform operation on a
single data file only. The file is imported via,
\verb"[File|Single Data Set...]" (Figure \ref{fig:QTloadingSingleDS}).
This will open a new file window as shown in figure
\ref{fig:QTNewFileDS}(a). The location of the file could be browsed
and respectively selected. The options buttons is supplied to select
the input format, which is performed by supplying a string such as
\texttt{xye}. Where \texttt{x}, \texttt{y} and \texttt{e} stands for
the scattering vector $Q$, scattering intensity $I(Q)$, \texttt{e}
signifies the error bar $\Delta I(Q)$ on the measured scattering intensity.
The error bars are required during the fitting operation and for files
which do not contain the error bar column it would be calculated by
default from the smoothing of the curve. There is an option to skip
lines at the beginning of the data, which is intended to be used to
skip header information in a data file , which could be misinterpreted
as data. The number $n$ specified in the menu defines the number of
lines skipped at the beginning of the data file.
Furthermore a file extension can be provided, unit conversions can be
performed as well as only non-negative $y$-values could be selected
for plotting and performing further analysis. On pressing ok the
data is loaded and the graph is plotted, with a new window labeled
merge files being opened.


\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
  \subfigure[Merge window for merging different $Q$ scales into a single profile]{\label{fig:QTmergeSDS1}
             \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{QTmergeSDS1.png}}

             \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{QTmergeRes.png}}
\caption{Merging many data files to one data set} \label{fig:QTmergeSDS}
\end{figure}

In SAS, data can be collected at different collimator and sample to
detector distances to correspond for a wide $Q$ scale. Thus for a
single sample at a given condition there can be more than one data
files, to merge all of them together for completing the scattering
profile, the above shown window comes into play. As shown in the
merge files window, the new file could be browsed and selected; it
has to be read using the read file button. The newly read file
is listed below the first file, if it's a wrong selection it could
be deleted back, also one can scale the different files measured at
different $Q$ windows, using the divisor column to have a continuous
scattering profile. After scaling all the data profiles into one
single profile, the statistically bad and unwanted data points can
be removed by skipping the points at the beginning and at the end of
the data files. The resolution parameters can be provided by
pressing the resolution button and the required information such as
sample to detector distance, collimation distance, cross section of
the guide etc as shown in figure  \label{fig:QTmergeSDS}(c) has to be entered to use
resolution smearing during the fitting. The new button is use to
discard all the current selections and plotted data files and starts
a new session. The file could also be imported by pasting the
clipboard data on the graph view as shown in the figure below. The
conditions for columns are same as that for reading the file via
browse method.


\section{Importing data files for multiple data sets}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{QTloadingMultipleDS1.png}
    \includegraphics[width=0.49\textwidth]{QTloadingMultipleDS2.png}
\caption{Procedure for importing data files for multiple data sets}
\label{fig:QTmergeMultipleDS1}
\end{figure}
The multiple data set option allows the user to perform operation on
multiple data files by using common set of (global) parameters. This
option is especially important in contrast variation experiments or
measurements with polarized neutrons. The global fit helps to
determine the fit parameters unambiguously which by analyzing a
single curve would be otherwise strongly correlated. The file is
imported by first going to multiple data sets for global fitting
(red box in Figure \ref{fig:QTmergeMultipleDS1}) and then via,
\verb"[File|Multiple Data Set...]". This will open a new window
as was the case for importing single data set
as shown below.
\begin{figure}[htb]

  \subfigure[Path and format selection for new file ]{\label{fig:QTloadingMultipleDS3}
             \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{QTloadingMultipleDS3.png}}

             \includegraphics[width=0.3\textwidth]{QTloadingMultipleDS4.png}}
  \subfigure[Merge window for input of multiple data sets. Red box shows the buttons
             from which additional data files could be imported.
             Whereas the features of merging the data set for different $Q$ scales
             is similar to that for importing single data set]{\label{fig:QTloadingMultipleDS5}
             \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{QTloadingMultipleDS5.png}}
\caption{Procedure for importing data files for multiple data sets}
\label{fig:QTmergeMultipleDS2}
\end{figure}
The procedure for importing the first file is same as was the case
for single file. On reading the first file the merge file window
opens, which has additional buttons as compared to the merge file
window in single data set (shown in the red rectangular box in
figure \ref{fig:QTmergeMultipleDS2}(c)). In multiple data fitting,
almost any number of data files could be loaded. The present active
number of data is shown next to the data set in the merge file
window. One can switch over from one data file to another by
clicking previous or next. Add and remove buttons are used to add or
remove another file. The addition of curves for different $Q$ scales
is performed similar to as mentioned in the Input single data set
introduction.

\section{Simulating scattering curves}

In addition to reading and loading data set, one can also have a
realistic view of the experimental scattering data for a known
structure by simulating the scattering profile beforehand to get a
feel of the actual experiment scattering profile. The simulation can
be performed either for a single data set or for multiple data sets
using global parameters. To generate theoretical scattering profile,
follow \verb"[Calc|Single Data Set...|simulate]" or
\verb"[Calc|Multiple Data Sets...|simulate]", either of them to generate
a single data set or multiple data sets varied by changing the global parameter. The
data can be generated for vast number of form factors and structure
factor included in the software. The simulation is calculated using
physically relevant parameters, this is useful to plan the
experiment and to know whether a given concentration and contrast
would produce a measurable signal.

\caption{Procedure for simulating data profiles for single as well as multiple data files}
\label{fig:QTsimulateDS}
\end{figure}

\section{Fitting}
{\tt SASfit } can analyse the data using both model-independent analysis
and using a non-linear least square method to fit models. The
model-independent analysis is a preliminary process of analyzing SAS
data and does not require any advanced knowledge of the system to
extract structural information this includes fittings (Guinier,
Kratky, Porod, power-laws, etc.). On the other hand in case of
non-linear least square methods a detailed fitting to the
experimental data is performed using a wide variety of form factors
and structure factors. The {\tt SASfit } model library consists of large
number of such functions, which can be readily used for the
analysis. Moreover it can also fit different size distributions.

\subsection{Model Independent Fitting (Integral parameters)} ~\\
Model independent analysis requires no advanced knowledge about the
sample and most importantly no experimental bias of assumed
structure. It includes linearized fitting (Guinier, Porod and Zimm
plot) to extract structural information. Model independent analysis
are performed via \verb"[Cals|integral parameters]". In {\tt SASfit }
there are basically three functions available to do the analysis;
they are Guinier, Zimm and Porod approximations (shown in the blue
box in Figure \ref{fig:QTintegralparameter}(b). The number of data points to be included in the
analysis can be accordingly varied and the resulting fit and the
available parameters can be viewed instantaneously. For a large
number of data a small script can be return to automate the process.
This is performed by using the lower section of the integral
structural parameters window (shown in red box). Prename indicates a
character or string of characters with which all the data file names
to be analysed starts with followed by certain numbers. The number
of digits/characters in the filename could be given in the digits
submission box, whereas the start number and the last file number
are provided in their respective submission boxes. The step box
indicates the incremental step of the file names which has to be
analysed. The fitted parameters can be saved in the custom file to
be viewed later. Load next file does step by step analysis of
different files, whereas Do all would perform calculations on the
entire file list, to be saved in the custom file for later viewing.

A set of valuable size and integrated parameters that can be
calculated directly from the scattering curves $I(Q)$
\cite{Damaschun1969,Sjoberg1974,Damaschun1971,Walter1985,Moller1995,book:Guinier:Fournet}
consists of
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\tilde{Q}_\text{inv} &= \int_0^\infty Q^2I(Q) \mathrm{d}Q \mbox{ (scattering invariant)} \\
\frac{S}{V} &= \frac{\pi}{\tilde{Q}_\text{inv}} \;\; {\displaystyle\lim_{Q \to \infty}\left\{Q^4I(Q)\right\}} \mbox{ (specific surface)} \\
\langle R_G \rangle^2 &= 3\left(-\displaystyle\lim_{Q \to 0}\left\{\frac{\mathrm{d}[\ln I(Q)]}{\mathrm{d}(Q^2)}\right\}\right) \mbox{ (squared Guinier radius)} \\
\langle d \rangle &= \frac{4}{\pi}\frac{\int_0^\infty Q^2I(Q) \mathrm{d}Q}{\displaystyle\lim_{Q \to \infty}\left\{Q^4I(Q)\right\}} \mbox{ (average intersection length)} \\
\langle l \rangle &= \frac{\pi}{\tilde{Q}_\text{inv}} \int_0^\infty QI(Q) \mathrm{d}Q \mbox{ (correlation length)} \\
\langle A \rangle &= \frac{2\pi}{\tilde{Q}_\text{inv}}\int_0^\infty I(Q) \mathrm{d}Q \mbox{ (correlation surface)} \\
\langle V \rangle &= \frac{2\pi^2}{\tilde{Q}_\text{inv}} I(0) \mbox{ (correlation volume, Porod volume)}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

\end{figure}
For Modeling a SANS data set the {\tt SASfit }-programm allows to
describe experimental data with an arbitrary number of scattering
objects types. Each of them can have a size distribution, whereby
the user can choose over which parameter $a_i$ of the form factor
the integration will be performed. For example in case of a
spherical shell with a core radius of $R$ and a shell thickness of
$\Delta R$ {\tt SASfit } allows to integrate either over the core
radius $x=R$ or the shell thickness $x=\Delta R$ by marking the
corresponding parameter (see option {\tt distr} in Fig .
\ref{fig:QTsinglefit}(b)). Furthermore an additional structure factor
can be included for each scattering object. Several ways to account
for the structure factor have been implemented like the monodisperse
approximation (\ref{sec:SQmonodisperse}), decoupling approach
(\ref{sec:SQdecoupling}), local monodisperse approximation
(\ref{sec:SQlocalmonodisperse}), partial structure factor
(\ref{sec:SQpartial}) and scaling approximation of partial structure
factors (\ref{sec:SQscaling}). The details are described in chapter
\ref{sec:structurefactor}.

Implemented size distributions, form factors and structure factors
are described in chapters \ref{formfactor},
\ref{sec:structurefactor} and \ref{sizedistribution}. Optional an
additional smearing of this function with the instrument resolution
function $R_{av}\left(Q,\langle Q\rangle\right)$ can be activated so
that
\begin{equation}
I(\langle Q\rangle) = \int_0^\infty R_{av}\left(Q,\langle
Q\rangle\right) \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(Q) \, dQ
\end{equation}

A user interface shown in Fig. \ref{fig:QTsinglefit} is supplied to
choose between the number of scattering objects and to define
parameter for each of them. Next to varying the different parameters
one can mark those, which one would like to fix or to vary in a
fitting procedure (see option {\tt fit} in Fig.
\ref{analyticalMenu}(b)) Model dependent analysis for single files
are performed via \verb"[Calc|Single Data Set|Fit...]".

\subsubsection{Modeling multiple data sets}~\\
\begin{figure}[htb]
\centering
  \subfigure[Imported multiple data sets]{\label{fig:QTmultiplefit1}
             \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{QTmultiplefit1.png}}

             \includegraphics[width=0.48\textwidth]{QTmultiplefit2.png}}
\caption{Menus for fitting a simultaneously multiple data sets}
\label{fig:QTmultiplefit}
\end{figure}
The multiple data set option allows the user to perform operation on
multiple data file by using common set (global) parameters. This
option is especially important in contrast variation experiments or
measurements with polarized neutrons. The global fitting helps the
user to analyse large number of data which has a similar form or
structure factor however different scaling constant. The data shown
in the figure below is for a spherical monodispersed system both the
data profile has identical features, except that the scaling factor
between the two is of a factor of two. The data are called by the
procedure explained in the input multiple data file section. The
fitting of the data is performed by calling the fitting function via
\verb"[Calc|Multiple Data Sets|Fit...]". The user interface for multiple
data fitting has additional feature than to that for single data
fitting, they are pre-factor and global parameters as shown in
figure \ref{fig:QTmultiplefit}(b) red markings.

\caption{Different windows showing different controlling parameters during multiple data fitting.}
\label{fig:QTmultiplefitUI}
\end{figure}

The procedure for fitting the data set is similar to that mentioned
in the earlier section. The only difference is to include the global
parameters for each function included. The scattering profile shown
in the figure \ref{fig:QTmultiplefit}(a) is for a spherical
monodispersed particle, both
the profiles have identical features with a scaling factor of two.
The user interface for fitting shows the following window in figures
\ref{fig:QTmultiplefitUI}. The data set number shows the active data file, whereas
contribution indicates the number of scattering objects. We have
selected the form factor for a spherical particle. In the global
parameter a new variable is produced for both radius and \texttt{eta}
(scattering contrast). The pre-factor is kept constant at 1. A
second contribution is added to the data set one by pressing add. In
this case it is a background contribution, a new global parameter is
introduced for it (\texttt{P3}). A similar procedure is done for second data
set where the global parameter for the radius is kept same to that
for data set one, whereas new global parameters are defined for
scattering contrast and background. The fitting procedure can then
be started by pressing Run fit. The figures \ref{fig:QTmultiplefitUIeg}
show the graphs during the fitting process. The parameters of fitting for all the
contribution can be viewed by pressing parameters of analytical size
distributions (figure \ref{fig:QTmultiplefitUIeg}(d)).

\section{Data I/O Formats}

\subsection{Input Format} \hspace{1pt}\\

{\tt SASfit } supports a simple ASCII format. Options for reading ASCII
data can be set in the corresponding menu, where one can set an
input format and the number of lines to be skipped at the beginning
of the data file. To set an input format one has to supply a string
like "{\tt xyer}". Each line which does not contain valid float
numbers are skipped automatically. Each line further should at least
contain as many valid numbers as the supplied format string
characters. That means if the line contains only three numbers but
the format string is 4 or more characters long the line will be
ignored. Separators between numbers can be "white space",
"tabulator", or ",". For identifying the columns the characters and
their position in the string are interpreted. {\tt x}, {\tt y} and
{\tt e} stands for the scattering vector $Q$, scattering intensity
$I(Q)$ and its error $\Delta I(Q)$, respectively. {\tt r} defines
the column for a resolution parameter $\sigma$. The position of the
character in the string defines which data column is assigned to
$Q$, $I(Q)$, $\Delta I(Q)$, and $\sigma$. In case of double
occurrence of a character the position of the last one is the
significant position. Any characters not belonging to \{{\tt x},{\tt
y},{\tt e},{\tt r}\} can be used to skip a column. A definition
string need to contain
at least the two characters {\tt x} and {\tt y}. \\

As the first lines start with a string, they will be automatically
ignored. To interpret the three columns as $Q$, $I(Q)$, $\Delta
I(Q)$ the format string should be simply {\tt xyz}. The HMI-BerSANS

A definition string {\tt ixye} would ignore the leading line number
at the beginning of each data line, but in the present example also
the first 3 lines would also be interpreted as data points. To skip
them one has to use the option for skipping leading lines in a data
file. In the above case the number should be set to 3 or 4. As the
4$^\text{th}$ line is anyway ignore a value of 3 is sufficient to
skip non data points.

} If one like to export the data of an $xy$-plot all curves are
stored in a single data file. Each curve will occupy four columns
($Q$, $I(Q)$, $\Delta I(Q)$, $\sigma$). If an error $\Delta I(Q)$ is
not available, e.g. for theoretical data curves, the corresponding
column will be filled with -1. Similar is valid for the resolution
parameter $\sigma$ which will be set to 0 in case it is not
available. The individual columns are separated by ",". If the curve
have different amount of data points the column will be filled with
empty space for the missing data. This comma separated data format
has been chosen as it can be imported easily by many commercial
plotting softwares. The drawback of this format is, however, that
{\tt SASfit } cannot read it correctly, if the individual curves are of
different length.

\section{Scattering length density calculator}
\label{sec:SLDcalculator}

The \texttt{SLD calculator} is using thermal neutron cross-sections
only to calculate neutron scattering length density. For x-rays the
energy dependent scattering coefficients $f'$ and $f''$ are derived
using the theoretical approximation developed by Cromer and
Liberman. This theory gives accurate values far from an absorption
edge but does not account for the effects of neighboring atoms,
which can be very substantial near an absorption edge. Before
conducting an anomalous scattering experiment close to an absorption
edge it is therefore advisable to determine the actual scattering
behavior of the sample. The x-ray data have been taken from
\url{http://skuld.bmsc.washington.edu/scatter/AS_periodic.html} and
those for neutrons from
\url{http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/resources/n-lengths/list.html}.
\begin{figure}[htb]

\includegraphics[width=0.329\textwidth,height=0.451\textwidth]{SLDcalculator.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Input menu for the scattering length density calculator}
\label{fig:SLDcalculator}
\end{figure}
The menu interface in Fig.\ \ref{fig:SLDcalculator} has for input
parameters, the sum formulae of the compound, its mass density in
g/cm$^3$, the x-ray energy in keV and the neutron wave length in nm.
In the compound name non-integer stoichiometry is supported, e.g.
H0.2O0.1 and H2O will calculate the same scattering length density.
However, the molecular volume $v_m$ and the molecular weight $M$ of
cause depend on such differences. The elements in the compound name
are case sensitive. Therefore you have to use \texttt{SiO2} instead
of \texttt{SIO2}. Also isotopes are handled like \texttt{C(13)}
(Carbon-13), \texttt{H(2)} (Deuterium), or \texttt{O(18)}
(Oxygen-18). For Deuterium next to \texttt{H(2)} also \texttt{D} can
be used.

Examples of how to format the compound name:
\begin{itemize}
\item Magnetite: \texttt{Fe3O4}, 5.15 g/cm$^3$
\item Eucryptite: \texttt{LiAlSiO4}, 2.67 g/cm$^3$
\item protonated toluene, \texttt{C7H8}, 0.865 g/cm$^3$
\item deuterated toluene, \texttt{C7D8} or \texttt{C7H(2)8}, 0.94 g/cm$^3$
\item mixture of 65/35 heavy water/light water, \texttt{(D2O)0.65(H2O)0.35}, 1.065 g/cm$^3$
\end{itemize}
From the compound name and the density first the molecular weight $M$, molecular volume $v_m$,
and total number of electrons $Z$ are calculated. Together with the tabulated neutron scattering length and
tabulated energy dependent scattering coefficient $f'(E)$ and $f''(E)$ the corresponding coherent
neutron scattering length $b_c=\sum_i b_i$, coherent neutron scattering length density
$\eta_{n,SLD}=b_c/v_m$  and
for x-rays the complex energy dependent scattering scattering length density
$\eta_{x,SLD}=\left(Z-(Z/82.5)^{2.37}+f'(E)+\imath f''(E)\right)/v_m$ of the compound are calculated.

\caption{Sketch of a vesicle with horizontally aligned flat
capped ends perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam}
\label{fig:Sketch_vesicle_capped_poles_aligned}
\end{figure}
The shape of this form factor consist of spherical vesicle containing to flat domains.
The flat thought to be aligned in a horizontal magnetic field perpendicular to the incoming
neutron beam. The size of the domains are characterized by the angles $\theta_1$ and
$theta_2$. The thicknesses $t_{c1}$ and $t_{c2}$ can be different than the thickness $t_{sh}$
of the spherical part of the vesicles. The same hold for the scattering length densities
$\eta_{c1}$, $\eta_{c2}$ and $\eta_{sh}$. The form factor $F_\text{cv}(Q)$ of this object can be
calculated by performing the Fourier transformation of the scattering length density in separate
steps. First one calculates the Fourier transformation of a sphere $F_\text{cSph}$
with flat capped ends on each side in cylinder coordinates.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
F_\text{cSph}(Q,R,\psi,\theta_1,\theta_2,\Delta\eta) = \Delta\eta \!\!
\int_{-R\cos\theta_2}^{R\cos\theta_1} \!\!\!\!\! \mathrm{d}z \!\!\!
\int_0^{\sqrt{R^2-z^2}}\!\!\!\!\! \mathrm{d}\rho \;
\int_0^{2\pi} \mathrm{d}\phi \;\; e^{\imath \mathbf{Q}\cdot\mathbf{r}}
\, \rho
\label{eq:FcSphInt}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\text{with} \quad
\mathbf{Q}=Q\left(
              \begin{array}{c}
                0 \\
                \sin\psi \\
                \cos\psi
              \end{array}
            \right)
\quad \text{and} \quad
\mathbf{r}= \left(
              \begin{array}{c}

                \rho \cos\phi \\

                z
              \end{array}
            \right)
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The form factor of vesicle $F_\text{cv}(Q)$ with a layer thickness of $t_\text{sh}$ can than
be calculated by
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
F_\text{cv}(Q,R,t_\text{sh},\theta_1,\theta_2,\Delta\eta_\text{sh}) =
    & + F_\text{cSph}(Q,R+t_\text{sh},\Theta_1,\Theta_2,\Delta\eta_\text{sh})  \\
    & - F_\text{cSph}(Q,R,            \theta_1,\theta_2,\Delta\eta_\text{sh})
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
\Theta_1 &= \arcsin\left(\frac{R_{c1}}{R+t_\text{sh}} \right), \quad R_{c1} = R \sin\left(\theta_1\right),\\
\Theta_2 &= \arcsin\left(\frac{R_{c2}}{R+t_\text{sh}} \right), \quad R_{c2} = R \sin\left(\theta_2\right).
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
As the flat capped ends are allowed to have independent thicknesses $t_\text{c1}$, $t_\text{c2}$ and
scattering length densities $\eta_\text{1}$, $\eta_\text{2}$ the scattering amplitude contribution of the
flat capped ends, which have the shape of a disc, need to be corrected. Their contribution can be calculated by

\item If the ellipse is rotated about its minor axis, the surface is an oblate spheroid.
\item If the generating ellipse is a circle, the surface is a sphere.

\caption{The underlying model for a polymer chain is an
isotropic random walk on the euclidean lattice $\mathbb{Z}^3$.
This picture shows three different walks after 10 000 unit steps,
all three starting from the origin. \label{fig:RandomWalk3D}}
\end{figure}

Consider a flexible polymer coil where each monomer located at a
distance $\mathbf{R}_m$ its scattering field amplitude is given by
\begin{align}
F(\mathbf{q},t) &= \sum_{m=1}^N e^{-\imath
\mathbf{q}\cdot\mathbf{R}_m(t)} .
\end{align}
The scattering intensity averaged over all molecule configurations
reads
\begin{align}
\left\langle {\left\vert \right\vert}{F(\mathbf{q})}^2\right\rangle
&= \sum_{m,n} \left\langle e^{-\imath\mathbf{q}\cdot(\mathbf{R}_m-\mathbf{R}_n)} \right\rangle
\end{align}
As the monomer segments $\mathbf{R}_m-\mathbf{R}_n$ are Gaussian distributed
the averages $\langle\cdots\rangle$ can be written as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\left\langle e^{-\imath\mathbf{q}\cdot(\mathbf{R}_m-\mathbf{R}_n)} \right\rangle
&= e^{\frac{q^2}{6}\left\langle \left( \mathbf{R}_m-\mathbf{R}_n\right)^2\right\rangle} \\
&= e^{-\frac{q^2b^2}{6}{\left\vert m-n\right\vert}^{2\nu}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Here $b$ is the statistical segment length and the contour length $L$ equals $L=Nb$.
The average of the segment inter-distances squares is kept in the general form
\begin{align}
\left\langle \left( \mathbf{R}_m-\mathbf{R}_n\right)^2\right\rangle
&= b^2 {\left\vert m-n\right\vert}^{2\nu}.
\end{align}
$\nu$ is the excluded volume parameter from the Flory mean field
theory\footnote{P.J. Flory, "Statistical Mechanics of Chain Molecules", Interscience Publishers (1969)}\footnote{\href{http://www.ncnr.nist.gov/staff/hammouda/the_SANS_toolbox.pdf}{Boualem Hammouda, \texttt{the\_SANS\_toolbox.pdf}}}
of polymer solutions. The radius of gyration $R_G$ is given by
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
R_G^2 &= \frac{1}{2N^2}\sum_{m,n}^N \left\langle \left( \mathbf{R}_m-\mathbf{R}_n\right)^2\right\rangle \\
      &= \frac{1}{2N^2}\sum_{m,n}^N b^2 {\left\vert m-n\right\vert}^{2\nu} \\
      &= \frac{b^2}{N} \sum_k^N \left(1-\frac{k}{N}\right) k^{2\nu} \\
      &= \frac{b^2}{\left(2\nu+1\right)\left(2\nu+2\right)} N^{2\nu}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
Three cases are relevant:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Self-avoiding walk corresponds to swollen chains with $\nu = 3/5$, for which
$R_G^2=\frac{25}{176}b^2N^{6/5}$.
\item Pure random walk corresponds to chains in $\Theta$-conditions (where solvent-solvent,
monomer-monomer and solvent-monomer interactions are equivalent) with $\nu = 1/2$,
for which $R_G^2=\frac{1}{6}b^2N$.
\item Self attracting walk corresponds to collapsed chains with $\nu = 1/3$, for which
$R_G^2=\frac{9}{40}b^2N^{2/3}$.
\end{enumerate}
Using the general identity
\begin{align}
\sum_{i,j}^N y({\left\vert i-j\right\vert}) = N+2\sum_{k=1}^N(N-k) y(k)
\end{align}
the form factor reads
\begin{align}
P(q) &= \frac{1}{N^2}{\left\vert F(q)\right\vert}^2 = \frac{1}{N^2}
\left\{N+2\sum_{k=1}^N(N-k)e^{-\frac{q^2b^2}{6}k^{2\nu}} \right\}
\end{align}
Going to the continuous limit $(N \gg 1)$, one obtains:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
P(q) &= 2\int_0^1 \mathrm{d}x \; (1-x)e^{-\frac{q^2b^2}{6}N^{2\nu}x^{2\nu}} \\
&= \frac{U^{\frac{1}{2 \nu}} \Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2 \nu}\right)-
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{\nu}\right)-U^{\frac{1}{2\nu}}
\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2 \nu},U\right)+\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{\nu},U\right)}{\nu U^{1/\nu}}
\label{eq:generalizedGauss}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
with the modified variable
\begin{align}
U&=\frac{q^2b^2N^{2\nu}}{6} = \left(2\nu+1\right)\left(2\nu+2\right)\frac{q^2R_G^2}{6}
\end{align}
and the unnormalized incomplete Gamma Function $\Gamma(a,x) = \int_x^\infty \mathrm{d}t \; t^{a-1} \exp(-t)$
for $a$ real and $x \geq 0$ and the Gamma function $\Gamma(a)=\Gamma(a,0)=\int_0^\infty \mathrm{d}t\;  t^{a-1} \exp(-t)$.
Polymer chains follow Gaussian statistics in polymer solutions: they are swollen in good
solvents $\nu=3/5$, are thermally relaxed in "theta"-solvents $\nu=1/2$ and partially precipitate in poor solvents $\nu=1/3$.
The familiar Debye function is recovered when $\nu = 1/2$. The asymptotic limit at large $q$-values of the generalized
Gaussian chain is dominated by the $\frac{1}{\nu U^{\frac{1}{2\nu}}}\Gamma\left(\frac{1}{2\nu}\right)$
term which varies like $U^{-1/(2\nu)} \sim q^{-1/\nu}$. For $\nu =1$ we get the limit of an infinitesimal thin rod
and for $\nu=1/4$ a compact object with a Porod law of $q^{-4}$.

{\tt SASfit } has implemented the generalized form of a Gaussian (\texttt{generalized Gaussian coil}) coil and the standard
Debye formula \texttt{Gauss}. In both cases three version are implemented which only differ in their parametrization of
the forward scattering. In case of the the Debye-formula also the polydisperse \texttt{GaussPoly} is implemented.

\begin{align}
I_\text{Gauss2}(q) &= \beta^2 2\frac{\exp(-u)+u-1}{u^2} \\
u &= q^2R_g^2  \\
\beta &= b_p-V\eta_\text{s}, 
\end{align}
where $b_p$ is the scattering length of a polymer molecule of molecular volume $V$ dissolved in a solvent
of scattering length density $\eta_\text{s}$ from which the excess scattering length of a polymer molecule
$\beta$ can be calculated. Combining this form factor with a \texttt{Delta} size distribution \ref{sec:Delta}
is needed to scale the scattering intensity. With proper values for the form factor the parameter $N$
of the \texttt{Delta}-distribution yields the particle number density.

\end{split} \label{eq:UEPL}
\end{align}
The first term in eq.\ \ref{eq:UEPL} describes the large-scale
structure of size $R_g$ composed of small subunits of
size $R_s$, captured in the third term. The second term describes
the mass-fractal regime with two structural limits. The low-$Q$
limit is at $R_g$ and is described by the error function. The
high-$Q$ limit is at $R_{sub}$ and is described by the exponential
pre-factor \cite{beaucage95} . The final two terms are for the
sub-structural mer unit. Using eq.\ \ref{eq:UEPL}, scattering from a
system with multiple-size-scale features is parameterized.
Generally, the high-$Q$ cutoff for the intermediate power law,
$R_{sub}$, is identical to the sub-structural radius of gyration,
$R_s$. The assumption that $R_{sub} = R_s$ should always be true
for typical mass fractals. It should be noted that, although eq.\
\ref{eq:UEPL} appears cumbersome, no new parameters have been
introduced over local fits using exponentials and power laws.

$G$ is the Guinier pre-factor defined above and $B$ is a
pre-factor specific to the type of power-law scattering:
$B$ is defined according to the regime in which the exponent
$P$ falls. Generally, for surface fractals $4 > P > 3$,
for mass fractals $P < 3$ and for diffuse interfaces $P>4$.
For Porod's law, $P=4$
and $B = N_p 2\pi \rho_c^2pS_p$, where $S_p$, is the particulate surface
area. For a Gaussian polymer, $P = 2$, and $B$ is given by
$2G/R_g^2$, through a comparison with the Debye form factor \ref{sect:GaussCoil}
at the high-$Q$ limit as discussed below.
The constant, $k$ in \ref{eq:UEPL}, accounts for
an approximation involved in the description of the low-$Q$
power-law limit \cite{beaucage95}. This is an empirical
constant that has a value of 1 for steep power-law decays,
$P > 3$. For weak power-law decays, $k$ deviates slightly
from 1. For polymeric mass fractals of fractal dimension
$d_f$ close to 2 (1.5 to 3), $k$ is empirically found to be close
to 1.06. Weak deviations are observed between the scattered
intensity as calculated using \ref{eq:UEPL} and exact
calculations for values of $Q$ between $2\pi/R_g$ and $\pi/R_g$ in
these cases when $k = 1$. These deviations are reduced to
less than 3\% of the calculated intensity using $k= 1.06$.

Kholodenko \cite{kholodenko93} presented a new approach using the analogy between Diracs fermions
and semi-flexible polymers. The form factor $P_0(Q)$ resulting
from Kholodenkos approach is designed to reproduce
correctly the rigid-rod limit and the random-coil limit.
Defining $x = 3L/l$ ($L$: contour length, $l$: Kuhn length), it is given by
\begin{align}
P_0(Q,L,l) &= \frac{2}{x} \left[I_{(1)} -\frac{1}{x}I_{(2)}\right]
\label{eq:Kholodenko}
\end{align}
where
\begin{align}
I_{(n)}(x) &= \int_0^x  f(z) \, z^{n-1} \, dz
\end{align}
together with
\begin{align}
f(z)) &=
\begin{cases} \displaystyle
\frac{1}{E}\frac{\sinh(Ez)}{\sinh(z)} & \text{for} \quad \displaystyle Q \leq \frac{3}{l}\\ \\
\displaystyle
\frac{1}{F}\frac{\sin(Fz)}{\sinh(z)} & \text{for} \quad \displaystyle Q > \frac{3}{l}
\end{cases}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
E = \sqrt{1-\left(\frac{lQ}{3}\right)^2} \quad \text{and} \quad F = \sqrt{\left(\frac{lQ}{3}\right)^2-1}
\end{align}

For flexible cylinders with a circular cross section and a uniform scattering
length density the cross section form factor is given by
\begin{align}
P_{cs} = \left(2 \frac{J_1(QR)}{QR}\right)^2
\end{align}
so that the overall form factor is given by
\begin{align}
P(Q,L,l,R) = P_0(Q,L,l)\, P_{cs}(Q,R)
\end{align}

For block copolymers, which form micelles, several form factor have
been implemented \cite{PedersenGerstenberg96,PedersenJApplCryst2000,SvaneborgPedersen2002}
for spherical, ellipsoidal, and cylindrical shapes.
It has been assumed that one unit is forming the core of the
micelles and the other the corona. The core is assumed to have a
homogeneous scattering length density, but may contain some amount
of solvent. For the polymer chains in the corona either a model
where Gaussian chains are attached to the core or a corona model of
semi-flexible interacting self-avoiding chains (only for spherical
core) or a continuous model, where a radial profile of the form
$\Phi(r)\varpropto r^{-\alpha}$ has been assumed. The form factors
have been parameterized such, that the excess scattering of the
corona and the core are consistent with the composition and density
of the two separate block units of the copolymer.

\subsubsection{Micelles with a homogeneous core and Gaussian chains on the surface}
\label{Chains(RW)} ~\\

It is assumed that the diblock copolymer consist of a block unit for
which the solvent is poor and a block unit with is good. The
insoluble blocks form a relatively compact core whereas the soluble
blocks form a diffuse corona surrounding the core. The form factor
of a micelle contains four different terms: the self-correlation
term of the core $N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}^2\,P_\text{core}(q)$,
the self-correlation term of the chains
$N_\text{agg}\beta_\text{brush}^2\,P_\text{brush}(q)$, the cross-term
between the core and chains
$2N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}\beta_\text{brush}\,S_\text{brush-core}(q)$,
and the cross term between different chains
$N_\text{agg}(N_\text{agg}-1)\beta_\text{brush}^2\,S_\text{brush-brush}(q)$.
It can be written (Pedersen \& Gerstenberg, 1996)
\begin{align}
I_\text{mic}    &= N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}^2\,P_\text{core}(q) + N_\text{agg}\beta_\text{brush}^2\,P_\text{brush}(q)  \label{eq:micelle}\\
                &+ 2N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}\beta_\text{brush}\,S_\text{brush-core}(q) + N_\text{agg}(N_\text{agg}-1)\beta_\text{brush}^2\,S_\text{brush-brush}(q)
\end{align}
$N_\text{agg}$ is the aggregation number of diblock polymers forming
the micelle and $\beta_\text{brush}=V_\text{brush}(\eta_\text{brush}-\eta_\text{solv})$
and $\beta_\text{core}=V_\text{core}(\eta_\text{core}-\eta_\text{solv})$
the excess scattering length of a block in the corona and in the core, respectively.
$V_\text{brush}$ and $V_\text{core}$ are the total volume of a block in the corona
and in the core. $\eta_\text{brush}$ and $\eta_\text{core}$ are the corresponding
scattering length densities and $\eta_\text{solv}$ is the scattering length
density of the surrounding solvent. The functions $P_\text{core}(q)$, $P_\text{brush}(q)$,
$S_\text{brush-core}(q)$, and $S_\text{brush-brush}(q)$ are all 1 for $q=0$. The definitions
of these four functions depend on the shape of the core and are given below.

\paragraph{\bf Spherical core:}
\label{sect:SphericalMicelles}
~\\

\begin{align}
P_\text{core}(q,R_\text{core}) &= \Phi^2(qR_\text{core}) \\
\Phi(qR) &= 3\frac{\sin(qR)-qR\cos(qR)}{(qR)^3}
\end{align}
\begin{align}
P_\text{brush}(q,R_g)&= 2\frac{\exp(-x)-1+x}{x^2} \text{~with~} x = R_g^2q^2
\end{align}
\begin{align}
S_\text{brush-core}(q,R_\text{core},Rg,d) &= \Phi(qR_\text{core})\psi(qR_g)\frac{\sin(q[R_\text{core}+dR_g])}{q[R_\text{core}+dR_g]} \\
\psi(qRg) &= \frac{1-\exp(-x)}{x} \text{~(form factor amplitude of the chain)} 
\end{align}
\begin{align}
S_\text{brush-brush}(q,R_\text{core},d,R_g) &= \psi^2(qR_g)\left[\frac{\sin(q[R_\text{core}+dR_g])}{q[R_\text{core}+dR_g]}\right]^2
\end{align}

For micelles with a spherical core a few different parameterizations have been
implemented \texttt{SPHERE+Chains(RW)}, \texttt{SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Rc} and
\texttt{SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Nagg}.
The parameters they all have in common are:
\begin{description}
\item[$V_\text{brush}$] molecular volume the diblock copolymer part forming the corona
\item[$\eta_\text{core}$] scattering length density of the diblock copolymer part forming the core

$d\sim 1$ for $R_\text{core}\gg R_g$

$n_\text{agg}=N_\text{agg}/S$ instead of $N_\text{agg}$. For the model \texttt{ROD+Chains(RW)\_nagg}
this means that the core radius has to be calculated by
$R_\text{core} = 2 n_\text{agg} V_\text{core} / (1-x_\text{solv,core})$

\subsubsection{Micelles with a homogeneous core
and a corona with decaying density profile .

The structure of block copolymer micelles may be described in terms
of the model of starlike polymer as proposed by Daoud and Cotton
\cite{DaoudCotton82}. Starlike polymers consist of a homogeneous,
dense polymer core surrounded by a polymer layer. As a consequence
of the spherical or cylindrical geometry, the density profile
$\phi(r)$ in the polymer layer decreases according to Wijmans \&
Zhulina \cite{Wijmans93} as
\begin{align}
\phi(r)
\begin{cases}
\phi_\text{core}    & \text{for~} r < R_\text{core} \\
\phi_\text{brush} \left(\frac{r}{R_\text{core}}\right)^{-\alpha}
                    & \text{for~} R_\text{core} \leq r \leq R_\text{core}+t \\
 0                  & \text{for~} r > R_\text{core}+t
\end{cases}
\label{eq:R_ma_profile}
\end{align}
with $\alpha =(D-1)(3\nu-1)/(2\nu)$.
$D$ is determined by the dimension of the curvature of the grafted surface
(spherical $D=3$, cylindrical $D=2$, planar $D=1$).
$\nu$ is the Flory exponent, which has characteristic
values as given in Table \ref{FloryExp}.
The corresponding density profile is schematically
shown in Figure \ref{R_ma_profile}. Micelles consist of a well-defined
micellar core with a radius $R_\text{core}$ and a micellar shell or
corona extending to the outer micellar radius $R_m=R_\text{core}+t$,
where $t$ is the thickness of the corona.

\begin{table}[htb]

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

For a given radial profile according to eq.\ \ref{eq:R_ma_profile} the form factor of
spherical micelle can be calculated by
\begin{align}
F_\text{SPHERE} &= \int_0^\infty 2\pi r^2 \phi(r) \frac{\sin(qr)}{qr}\,dr
\end{align}
In case of a rod-like micelle the form factor can be separated in two terms
$I(q) = P_H(q)P_\text{cs}(q)$ as already in shown in eq.\ \ref{eq:rodlikeFF}.
The cross-term contribution to the scattering intensity is given by
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
P_\text{cs}(q) &=  F_\text{cs}^2(q) \\
F_\text{cs}(q) &=  \int_0^\infty 2\pi r \phi(r) J_0(q)\,dr
\end{split}
\end{align}
However, as it is more convenient here to formulate the scattering intensity in
terms of excess scattering length of the block units in the core $\beta_\text{core}$
and the corona $\beta_\text{brush}$ like in eq.\ \ref{eq:micelle} the form factor
is split into two parts, the form factor of the homogeneous core $F_\text{core}(q)$ and
the form factor of the corona $F_\text{brush}(q)$. The overall scattering intensity $I(q)$
is than given by
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
I(q) &=   N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}^2 F_\text{core}^2(q)
       + 2 N_\text{agg}^2\beta_\text{core}\beta_\text{corona} F_\text{core}(q) F_\text{corona}(q) \\
     & +   N_\text{agg}(N_\text{agg}-1) \beta_\text{corona}^2 F_\text{corona}^2(q)
       +   N_\text{agg} P_\text{brush}(q)
\end{split}
\label{masterR_ma}
\end{align}
The excess scattering length of a block in the corona and in the core, respectively,
$\beta_\text{brush}=V_\text{brush}(\eta_\text{brush}-\eta_\text{solv})$
and $\beta_\text{core}=V_\text{core}(\eta_\text{core}-\eta_\text{solv})$ are
defined in the same way than in eq.\ \ref{eq:micelle}.
$V_\text{brush}$ and $V_\text{core}$ are the total volume of a block in the corona
and in the core. $\eta_\text{brush}$ and $\eta_\text{core}$ are the corresponding
scattering length densities and $\eta_\text{solv}$ is the scattering length
density of the surrounding solvent. $F_\text{core}(q)$ is the form factor of the core and
normalized to 1 for $q=0$. Also the form factor of the corona $F_\text{corona}(q)$ and the
form factor of the local fluctuations in the corona originating from the individual chains
$P_\text{brush}(q)$ are normalized to 1 for $q=0$. Similar to section \ref{Chains(RW)}
models for spherical and rod-like shapes have been implemented which are described in the
following paragraphs.

\begin{align}
F_{core}^2(q,R) &= 3\frac{\sin(qR)-qR\cos(qR)}{(qR)^3}
\end{align}
\begin{align}

   \int_{R_\text{core}}^{R_\text{core}+t} 2\pi r^2 r^{-\alpha} \frac{\sin(qr)}{qr} \, dr

For the scattering contribution of the individual chains in the corona
$P_\text{brush}$ the scattering function for worm-like chains with excluded
volume and negligible cross-section, contour length $L$ and Kuhn-length $b$
according to section \ref{sect:WormLikeChain} has been implemented.

For micelles with a spherical core a few different parameterizations have been
implemented \texttt{SPHERE+R$\hat{~}$-a}, \texttt{SPHERE+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Rc} and
\texttt{SPHERE+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Nagg}.

\paragraph{\bf rodlike core:}
\label{sect:ROD+R_ma}~\\
In case of a rod-like micelle the form factor can be separated in two terms $I(q) =
P_H(q)P_\text{cs}(q)$ as already in shown in eq. \ref{eq:rodlikeFF}. The cross-term contribution to the scattering
intensity is given by
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
P_\text{cs}(q) &=  F_\text{cs}^2(q) \\
F_\text{cs}(q) &= \int_0^\infty 2\pi r \phi(r) J_0(qr)\,dr
                = F_\text{cs,core}(q)+F_\text{cs,brush}(q)
\end{split}
\end{align}
The contribution of the homogeneous core is given by
\begin{align}
F_\text{cs,core}(q) = \frac{2 J_1(qR_c)}{qR_c}
\end{align}
and for the corona by
\begin{align}
F_\text{cs,brush}(q) &=\frac{1}{c_\alpha}\int_{R_c}^{R_c+t} 2\pi r \, r^{-\alpha} J_0(qr)\,dr
\end{align}
\begin{align}
c_\alpha &= \int_{R_c}^{R_c+t} 2\pi r \, r^{-\alpha}\,dr  \\
&= \begin{cases}
2\pi\ln\left(\frac{R_c+t}{R_c}\right)                                   & \text{~for~} \alpha = 2   \\
\frac{2}{2-\alpha} \pi \left((R_c+t)^{2-\alpha}-R_c^{2-\alpha}\right)   & \text{~for~} \alpha \neq 2
\end{cases}
\end{align}

For the scattering contribution of the individual chains in the corona $P_\text{local}$ normally
can be neglected for rod-like micelles in contrast to spherical structures as for structures
with a lower dimension than spheres, this contribution becomes more and more negligible. To account
for the scattering of the individual chains at least in first approximation and without introducing
new parameters a form factor similar to the one of star polymers has been implemented.
\begin{align}
P_\text{local}(q) &=
             \frac{\Gamma(\mu)}{qt}
             \frac{\sin\left(\mu \arctan(q t)\right)}{\left(1+q^2t^2\right)^{\mu/2}} \\
\mu &=\frac{1}{\nu}-1 ,\quad
\alpha = \frac{3\nu-1}{2\nu} \quad
\Leftrightarrow \quad \mu = 2(1-\alpha) 
\end{align}
The form factor to describe the scattering of the individual chains
is identical to the blob scattering contribution in star-like polymers according to
Dozier (\ref{sect:DozierStar}). The exponential damping length $\xi$ in the definition of the star
polymer has been set to the shell thickness $t$. In the original
paper of Pedersen the $P_\text{local}$ was described by the scattering of a semi-flexible chain with
excluded volume according to section \ref{sect:WormLikeChain}, which however would require to define
two more parameters.

For micelles with a rod-like core a few different parameterizations have been
implemented \texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a}, \texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Rc} and
\texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a\_Nagg}.

The expressions have been derived by Pedersen and Gerstenberg
\cite{PedersenGerstenberg96,PedersenJApplCryst2000}. For a sphere with radius $R$ and total excess scattering
length $\rho_s$ with $N_\text{agg}$ attached chains
\begin{align}

where $R_g$ is the root-mean-square radius of

\subsection{Sphere with Gaussian chains attached (block copolymer micelle)} ~\\

This form factor is the same than for \texttt{SphereWithGaussChains}. It has only been slightly re-parametrised.
Instead of the core radius $R$ and excess scattering lengths $\rho_s$ and $\rho_c$  the
volumes $V_\text{polym,c}$ and $V_\text{polym,sh}$ of the block units building the core and the shell are required
together with the corresponding scattering length densities $\eta_\text{poly,c}$, $\eta_\text{poly,sh}$ and
that one of the solvent $\eta_\text{solv}$. Furthermore $x_\text{solv,c}$ is the amount of solvent in the core which
takes account for a possible swelling of the core. These parameters allow one to calculate the core radius and
excess scattering lengths by
\begin{align}
    R &= \left({\left\vert \right\vert}{ \frac{N_\text{agg}V_\text{polym,c}}{1-x_\text{solv,c}}} \frac{3}{4\pi}\right)^{1/3}   \\
    \rho_s &= V_\text{polym,c} \left(\eta_\text{poly,c}-\eta_\text{solv} \right) \\
    \rho_c &= V_\text{polym,sh} \left(\eta_\text{poly,sh}-\eta_\text{solv}\right)
\end{align}

The volumes $V_\text{polym,c}$ and $V_\text{polym,sh}$ can be calculated by knowing the molecular weights\footnote{$u=1.660 538 86 \times 10^{-27}$ kg}
of the block units of the polymer in the core $M_\text{polym,c}$ and in the shell $M_\text{polym,sh}$ together
with their bulk mass densities $\rho_\text{polym,c}$ and $\rho_\text{polym,sh}$. The volumes are then
given by
\begin{align}
V_\text{polym,c} = \frac{M_\text{polym,c}}{N_a\, \rho_\text{polym,c}}
\quad \text{ and } \quad
V_\text{polym,sh} = \frac{M_\text{polym,sh}}{N_a\, \rho_\text{polym,sh}}
\end{align}
whereby $N_a$ is Avogadro's constant\footnote{$N_a = 6.022 1415 \times 10^{23} \text{mol}^{-1}$}. The units of the block units
has to be supplied in units corresponding to the scattering vector $Q$, i.e. in nm$^3$ in case $Q$ is given in nm$^{-1}$

\section{Bi-continuous and non-particular structures}
\subsection{TeubnerStrey}
\label{sect:TeubnerStrey}~\\

The Teubner and Strey \cite{TeubnerStrey87,StreyKlineKaler1994}
phenomenological model often accurately describes scattering from
bi-continuous micro-emulsions. The scattered intensity for this
model is
\begin{align}
I(q) = \frac{8\pi\langle\eta^2\rangle/\xi}{a^2-2bq^2+q^4}
\end{align}
where $a^2=(k^2+1/\xi^2)^2$ is a positive quantity, and
$b=k^2-1/\xi^2$ can be a positive or negative depending on the
relative magnitude of $d=2\pi/k$ and $\xi$. A positive $b$, i.e.
$\xi>d/2\pi$, leads to a peak at $q_\text{max}=\sqrt{b}$ whereby for
$\xi<d/2\pi$, hence negative $b$, no distinct peak appears. The
length scale $d$ represents a quasi-periodic repeat distance between
water and oil regions within the solution, while the correlation
length, $\xi$ , corresponds to a characteristic length for
positional correlation. $k$ is defined as $2\pi/d$. The
corresponding isotropic real space correlation function,
$\gamma(r)$, that incorporates alternating regions of the two phases
in the bi-continuous system (e.g. water and oil), is given by
\begin{align}
\gamma(r) = \frac{\sin(kr)}{kr} \exp\left(-\frac{r}{\xi} \right)
\end{align}

\subsection{Debye Anderson Brumberger(DAB)}
\label{sect:DAB}~\\

This form factor calculates the scattering from a randomly
distributed (i.e. non-particulate), two-phase system based on the
Debye-Anderson-Brumberger (DAB) \cite{DAB1957,DebyeBueche1949} model
for such systems. The two-phase system is characterized by a single
length scale, the correlation length $\xi$, which is a measure of
the average spacing between regions of phase 1 and phase 2. The
model also assumes smooth interfaces between the phases and hence
exhibits Porod behavior ($I \propto q^{-4}$) at large $q$ ($q \xi
\gg 1$). The pair correlation function is give by
\cite{DebyeBueche1949}
\begin{align}
\gamma(r) = \exp(-r/\xi)
\end{align}
The macroscopic scattering cross-section in the DBA model is given

Spinodal decomposing systems show a characteristic small angle
scattering signal with a correlation peak at some scattering value
$q_\text{max}$. The scattering curve $I(q)$ can be approximated by
\begin{align}
I(q) = I_\text{max} \frac{(1+\gamma/2)x^2}{\gamma/2+x^{2+\gamma}}
\end{align}
according to Furukawa \cite{Furukawa1984}, where $x=q/q_\text{max}$.
The position of the correlation peak at $q_\text{max}$ contain
information about the size of the structures, which scatter. The
exponent $\gamma$ is equal to $\gamma=D+1$ for off-critical mixtures
and $\gamma=2D$ for critical concentration mixtures, whereby $D$ is
the dimensionality of the system.

out as $\gamma(r) \simeq \frac{1}{r}exp(-r/\xi)$. Note that the
low-$Q$ limit of this empirical form reproduces the Guinier law.

\subsection{BroadPeak}
\label{sect:BroadPeak}
 ~\\
Many SANS spectra are characterized by a broad peak even though they
are from amorphous soft materials. The $d$-spacing corresponding to
the broad peak is a characteristic distance between the scattering
inhomogeneities (such as in lamellar, cylindrical, or spherical
morphologies or for bicontinuous structures). The following simple
functional form reproduces the broad peak feature:
\begin{align}
I(q) = \frac{I_0}{1+\left({\left\vert q-q_0\right\vert}\xi\right)^m}
\end{align}
Here the peak position is related to the $d$-spacing as $q_0 =
2\pi/d$. Soft systems that show a SANS peak include copolymers,
polyelectrolytes, multiphase systems, layered structures, etc.

\end{figure}
Quantitative analysis of particle size and shape starts with the
Guinier approximations. For three-dimensional objects the Guinier
approximation is given by $I(q) = \exp(-Rg^2q^2/3)$ This
approximation can be extended also to rod-like and plane objects by
\begin{align}
I(q) &= \left\{
\begin{array}{lll}
  1 & \mbox{for} & \alpha=0 \\
  \alpha \pi q^{-\alpha} & \mbox{for} & \alpha=1,2 \\
\end{array}
\right\} A \,\, \exp\left(-\frac{R_\alpha^2 q^2}{3-\alpha}\right)
\label{eq:generalizedGuinier}
\end{align}
\begin{description}
\item[$\alpha=0$] spheroid
\item[$\alpha=1$] rod-like
\item[$\alpha=2$] plane
\end{description}
The apparent particle shape (also called the dimensionality) is
represented in eq.\ \ref{eq:generalizedGuinier} by $\alpha$, which
has integer values of 0, 1, and 2 for a point, a line, and a plane,
respectively. Equation \ref{eq:generalizedGuinier} states that there
are $q$ ranges, corresponding to length scales as $q^{-1}$, from
which the particle dimension or shape, $\alpha$, the radius of
gyration, $R_\alpha$, and the pre-factor, $A$, characteristic of
$\alpha$ can be inferred. $\alpha$ has a value of 0 for a $q$ range
such that $qR_g < 1-1.3$ (the larger applies when the particle is
known to be a spheroid), where $R_g$ is the particle radius of
gyration (computed about the particle centroid). In this case, the
pre-factor $A$ describes the excess differential cross-section per
unit mass (cm$^2$ g$^{-1}$) of a particle. If the particle has one
dimension of length $L$, that is, much larger than the others (i.e.,
elongated, rod-like, or worm-like), then there is a $q$ range such
that $qR_c < 1 \ll qL$, where $\alpha = 1$. Here, $R_c$ is the
radius of gyration (computed about a line centered along $L$) of the
cross-section perpendicular to $L$. If these conditions apply, the
pre-factor $A$ describes the excess differential cross section per
unit length per unit mass (cm$^2$ \AA$^{-1}$ g$^{-1}$). Finally, for
planar shapes, including single bilayer vesicles, with two locally
large dimensions, $D$, and planar cross-sectional radius of gyration
(computed about a central plain),$R_d$, there may be a region of $q$
such that $qR_d < 1 \ll qD$, where $\alpha = 2$. For such planar
structures, the pre-factor is the excess differential cross-section
per unit area per unit mass (cm$^2$ \AA$^{-2}$ g$^{-1}$) of a sheet.

Aggregates and clusters often have a fractal morphology. These self-similar clusters are well
described by
\begin{align}
N=k_0(R_g/r_0)^D
\end{align}
where $N$ is the number of primary particles or monomers in the aggregate,
$k_0$ is a constant of order unity, $R_g$ is the radius of gyration of the aggregate,
$r_0$ is the monomer radius, and $D$ is the fractal dimension.

The scattering function and the density autocorrelation function
of the aggregate are Fourier transform pairs; thus
\begin{align}
I(q)=4\pi \int_0^\infty \, g(r)\, r^2\, \frac{\sin(qr)}{qr}\, dr
\label{eq:aggregateSQ}
\end{align}
For a fractal aggregate the autocorrelation function has the
form
\begin{align}
g(r) \sim r^{D-d} h(r,\xi)
\label{eq:aggregate_g(r)}
\end{align}
Here $D$ is the fractal dimension, $d$ the spatial dimension, and
$\xi$ a measure of the linear size of the aggregate proportional to
the radius of gyration $R_g$. The function $h(r,\xi)$ is the cutoff
function describing the perimeter of the aggregate. Its properties
are that $h(r,\xi) \simeq 1$ for $r/\xi \lesssim 1$, but for large
$r/\xi$ it falls off faster than any power law.

\noindent The scattering amplitude of a cylindrical shell is given by
\begin{align}
K_\text{CylShell}\left(Q,\dots,\gamma\right)  = &K_\text{Cyl}\left(Q,\eta_\text{core}-\eta_\text{shell},R,L,\gamma\right) \\
& +  K_\text{Cyl}\left(Q,\eta_\text{shell}-\eta_\text{solv},R+\Delta

\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
K_\text{Cyl}(Q,\Delta\eta,R,L,\gamma) & = 2 \pi R^2 L \Delta \eta
    \frac{J_1\left(Q R \sin\gamma\right)}{Q R \sin\gamma} \,
    \frac{\sin\left(\frac{QL}{2} \cos\gamma\right)}{\frac{QL}{2} \cos\gamma}
\end{align}
where $\gamma$ is the angle between $\mathbf{Q}$ and the cylinder
axis $\mathbf{n}$. $L$ is the length of the cylinder, $R$ its
radius, $\Delta\eta$ the scattering length density contrast relative
to the solvent and $J_1(x)$ is the first order Bessel function of
the first kind. $\gamma$ can be calculated from the orientation
($\theta$, $\phi$) of the cylinder and the direction of the
scattering vector $\psi$ in the plane of the detector by
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathbf{Q}}{{\left\vert \right\vert}{\mathbf{Q}}} &=
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \psi \\
0  \\
\sin \psi
\end{pmatrix} \qquad
\frac{\mathbf{n}}{{\left\vert \right\vert}{\mathbf{n}}} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\cos \theta \\
\sin \theta \sin \phi  \\
\sin \theta \cos \phi
\end{pmatrix} \\
\cos \measuredangle(\mathbf{Q,n}) &= \cos \gamma = \frac{\mathbf{Q\cdot
n}}{{\left\vert \right\vert}{\mathbf{Q}}{\left\vert \right\vert}{\mathbf{n}}} = \cos\psi \cos\theta +
\sin\psi \sin\theta \cos\phi
\end{align}
If the orientation distribution of the orientation vector $\mathbf{n}$ is described by $p(\theta,\phi)$
so that the scattering intensity is given by
\begin{align}
I_\mathrm{p.a.CylShell}(Q) & =
            \int_0^\pi d\theta \int_0^{2\pi} d\phi \, \,
                K_\text{CylShell}\left(Q,\dots,\gamma\right)\,p(\theta,\phi)\,\sin(\theta)
\end{align}
For this form factor it is assumed that the orientation distribution is independent of $\phi$,
i.e. $p(\theta,\phi)=p(\theta)$ and that $p(\theta)=p(\pi-\theta)$, which means that turning
the cylinder by 180$^\circ$ results in the same scattering intensity. Instead of assuming a
special parametrization of $p(\theta)$ the orientation distribution was expanded in terms of
Legendre polynomials $P_l(\cos(\theta))$
\begin{align}
p(\theta) & = \sum_{l=0,even}^\infty \frac{2l+1}{2} \left\langle P_l\right\rangle\, P_l(\cos(\theta))
\end{align}
Due to the symmetrie $p(\theta)=p(\pi-\theta)$ all terms with odd values for $l$ are zero and only the
even terms needs to be considered. For this form factor the first three terms up to $l=6$ are implemented.
As $\int_0^\pi p(\theta) \sin\theta \, d\theta =1$ the zero order parameter is one $\left\langle P_0 \right\rangle=1$.

\section{Planar Objects}
The form factor of very anisotropic particles with local planar
geometry can be shown to factorize (see, e.g., Porod, 1948) into a
cross section form factor $P_\text{cs}(Q)$ for the shorter
dimensions and a shape factor $P'(Q)$ for the larger dimension:
\begin{align}
P_\text{planar}(Q) = P'(Q) P_\text{cs}(Q)
\end{align}
The shape form factor $P'(Q)$ can be that of an infinitely thin
spherical shell, elliptical shell, cylindrical shell, or disk. In
the following the shape form factor is assumed to the one of an
infinitely thin disk:
\begin{align}
P'(Q,R)=\frac{2\pi^2R^4}{(QR)^2}
\left(1-\frac{\text{J}_1(2QR)}{QR}\right)

\end{figure}

The scattering from monodisperse dilute (non-interacting)
isotropic solution of anisotropic micelles is given by \begin{equation} I(Q) =
\left< \vert F(Q)\vert^2 \right>_Q \label{IQ_av} \end{equation} where $F(Q)$
is the form factor for a micelle at a given orientation relative
to the momentum transfer $Q$ and $\left<\right>_Q$ denotes an
average over all such orientations.

For a uniform cylinder of length $L$ and diameter $2R$ the form
factor is given by:
\begin{equation} F(Q) = F(Q,\gamma) = 2\Delta\eta V
\frac{\sin\left(QL/2\cos\gamma\right)}{QL/2\cos\gamma}
\frac{J_1(QR\sin\gamma)}{QR\sin\gamma}
\end{equation}
where $\gamma$ is the
angle between $Q$ and the cylinder axis, $V$ is the volume,
$\Delta\eta$ the scattering length density contrast relative to
the solvent, $J_1(x)$ is the first order Bessel function of the
first kind.

The scattering geometry for shear alignment is shown in Fig.
\ref{shear_cuette_SANS_geometry}. In general perfect alignment
will not be achieved, and an orientation distribution must be

\section{Magnetic Scattering}
\label{sect:MagScatt}

In the case of magnetic moments in the sample, the neutron undergoes
a magnetic interaction in addition to the nuclear interaction. The
corresponding interaction potential is given by
$$
V(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$}) = -\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_N \cdot \mbox{\boldmath$ B$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})
\quad \text{with} \quad \mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_N=\gamma\frac{e \hbar}{2m_N
c}\mbox{\boldmath$ \sigma$}
$$
where  $\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_N=\gamma\frac{e \hbar}{2m_N c}\mbox{\boldmath$ \sigma$}$ is the
magnetic dipole moment of the neutron, \mbox{\boldmath$ \sigma$} the Pauli spin
operator, $\gamma = -1.913$ the gyromagnetic ratio and
$\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})$ the magnetic field induced by an atom at the
position of the neutron. The latter has two components, one
induced by the magnetic dipole moment  $\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_S$ of the
electrons, denoted $\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}_S(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})$, and one by their orbital
moment $\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_L$, denoted $\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}_L(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})$. The (weak)
magnetic interaction $V(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$}) =
-\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_N\cdot(\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}_S(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})+\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}_L(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$}))$
 can as well be
treated in first Born approximation, resulting in the magnetic
scattering amplitude, in analogy to the nuclear scattering
amplitude, given by the Fourier transform of the magnetic
interaction potential $\mathcal {F}[V(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})]$: \begin{equation} b_M
=-\frac{m_N}{2\pi\hbar^2}\, \mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_N \cdot \int d^3r \,
e^{\imath\mbox{\boldmath$ Qr$}}\, (\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}_S(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})+\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}_L(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})). \end{equation} An
additional static magnetic field $\mbox{\boldmath$ H$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})$ at the point of
local magnetization $\mbox{\boldmath$ H$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})$ (stemming from
$\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}_S(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})+\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}_L(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})$) induces a total local magnetic
induction of
$$\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})=\mu_0(\mbox{\boldmath$ H$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})+\mbox{\boldmath$ M$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$}))$$
and the Fourier transform of   yields \begin{equation} \mbox{\boldmath$ B$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) = \mu_0\,
\frac{\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}\times [\mbox{\boldmath$ M$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})\times\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}]}{Q^2}
             = \mu_0\, \mbox{\boldmath$ M$}_{\bot}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})
             = \mu_0\, \mbox{\boldmath$ M$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \sin(\angle(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q,M$}))
\end{equation} where $\mbox{\boldmath$ M$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) = \int d^3r \exp(\imath\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}\cdot\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})
\mbox{\boldmath$ M$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})$ , with  $\mbox{\boldmath$ M$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ r$})$ given in units of Am.
$\mbox{\boldmath$ M$}_{\bot}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) = \mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}\times [\mbox{\boldmath$ M$}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})\times\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}] /
Q^2$ is the magnetization component perpendicular to the
scattering vector $Q$. The magnetic scattering length then is \begin{equation}
b_M = D_M\, \mu_0\, \mbox{\boldmath$\sigma$}\cdot
\mbox{\boldmath$ M$}_{\bot}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \mbox{~ with ~} D_M =
\frac{m_N}{2\pi\hbar^2}\, \mu_N = 2.3161 \times 10^{14} \,
\frac{1}{\mbox{Vs}}. \end{equation} For the differential scattering cross
section one finally obtains \begin{equation} \frac{d\sigma_M}{d\Omega}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) =
\frac{D_M^2}{N}{\left\vert \right\vert}{\mu_0 \mbox{\boldmath$ M$}_{\bot}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2 \end{equation} In the
presence of a preferred direction, for example induced by an
external magnetic field, the magnetic scattering depends on the
spin state   of the neutrons. Let the z-axis be the preferred
direction, and let ($+$) and ($-$) denote the neutron spin
polarizations parallel and antiparallel to the z-axis, then the
scattering is described by four scattering processes: two
processes where the incident states ($+$) and ($-$) remain
unchanged ($++$ and $--$), the so-called 'non-spin-flip'
processes, and two processes where the spin is flipped ($+-$ and
$-+$), the 'spin-flip' processes. Keeping in mind that the nuclear
scattering does not flip the neutron spin, the four related
scattering lengths are

\begin{align}
b_{\pm\pm} &= b_N \mp D_M\, \mu_0\, M_{\bot x} \\
b_{\pm\mp} &= - D_M\, \mu_0\, (M_{\bot z} \pm \imath \, M_{\bot
y}).
\end{align}
Hereby $b_N$ is the nuclear scattering length. For an unpolarized
neutron beam (which may be taken as composed of 50\% ($+$) and
50\% ($-$) polarization) the square of the modulus of the
scattering length is
 \begin{equation} (b_{++}^2+b_{--}^2+b_{+-}^2+b_{-+}^2)/2 = b_N^2+D_M^2
\mu_0^2 M_{\bot}^2. \end{equation} The differential cross section of the
unpolarized neutron beam can therefore be described by the sum of
the nuclear and the magnetic cross section, without any cross
terms.

\section{Lorenz-Mie Form Factors for Static Light Scattering}
\label{sect:LorenzMieSLS}

Mie theory, also called Lorenz-Mie theory \cite{Mie1908,Hulst1957,Bohren1983},
is a complete mathematical-physical theory of the scattering of electromagnetic
radiation by spherical particles. Mie theory is named after its
developer German physicist Gustav Mie (1868 Rostock - 1957
Freiburg im Breisgau) and Danish physicist Ludvig Lorenz
(1829-1891) who independently developed the theory of
electromagnetic plane wave scattering by a dielectric sphere in
1908.


Mie scattering describes the scattering of electromagnetic
radiation by spherical particles of any size $r$, relative to the
wavelength, $\lambda$. Since the cases $r \ll \lambda$ and $r \gg
\lambda$ are covered by Rayleigh (dipole) scattering and geometric
scattering theories, respectively, Mie scattering often refers to
the case of $r \sim \lambda$.



\subsection{MieSphere}
\label{sect:MieSphere}
 ~\\

The Mie scattering formulae are given in several books (Van
de Hulst, 1957; Kerker, 1969; Deirmendjian, 1969) and by Dave
(1968a, 1969a), although not always in the forms most suited to
computation. The algorithm used here is based on the MIEV0 package
described in \cite{Wiscombe1979,Wiscombe1980}.
The following input values are used:
\begin{align}
   \Theta &= 2\arcsin(Q\lambda/(4\pi)) \text{~with~} Q<Q_\text{max}=4\pi/\lambda   \\
 R &= \text{radius of scattering sphere}  \\
 \lambda & = \text{wavelength of incident plane
 wave inside the solvent}  \\
m & = \text{complex refractive index of sphere relative to
surrounding medium}  \\
  & = m_\text{re} - i m_\text{im}  \\
  & \vert m \vert \geq 1 \text{~and~} m_\text{im} \geq 0  \\
  & \text{or}  \\
  &  \vert m\vert  < 1 \text{~and~} m_\text{im} = 0  \\
  \text{pol} & = 0 \text{~ unpolarized light}  \\
  \text{pol} & = 1 \text{~ parallel to scattering plane polarized light}  \\
  \text{pol} & = -1 \text{~ perpendicular to scattering plane polarized light} 
 \end{align}
 $\vert m\vert < 1$ would, for example, include visible light scattering from air
 bubbles in water.

This form factor is basing on the version of MieLay, which
computes electromagnetic scattering by a stratified sphere, i.e. a
particle consisting of a spherical core surrounded by a spherical
shell.  The surrounding medium is assumed to have refractive index
unity. The formulas, manipulated to avoid the ill-conditioning
that plagued earlier formulations, were published
in \cite{Toon1981}.
Further documentation, including definitons of input and
output  arguments, is inside the single precision version of this
program ({\tt SUBROUTINE MieLay}, available by anonymous ftp from
{\tt climate.gsfc.nasa.gov} in directory {\tt pub/wiscombe}). The
following input values are used:
\begin{align}
   \Theta &= 2\arcsin(Q\lambda/(4\pi)) \text{~with~} Q<Q_\text{max}=4\pi/\lambda   \\
 R_\text{c} &= \text{radius of the core of scattering sphere}  \\

  & \text{or}  \\
  &  \vert m_\text{c}\vert  < 1 \text{~and~} m_\text{c,im} = 0  \\

\subsection{SuperParStroboPsi}  ~\\

In the following the scattering of polarized incident neutrons with polarization analysis (POLARIS) is described.
Experimental measured scattering signal are always a mixture of the spin dependent scattering cross-sections
$I^{\pm\pm}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$ and $I^{\pm\mp}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$. The relative contribution of these cross-sections to the measured cross-section
depend on the polarisation of the polarizer $P_{pol}$ the efficiency of the spin flipper $\epsilon$ and the
transmission values $T_\pm$ of the polarization analyzer, which is assumed to be an opaque He-filter.
If the neutron polarization of the polarizer is $P_{pol}\in [-1;1]$ and the spin flipper is off the incident
polarisation on the sample $P_{in}$ is given by
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
P_{in} &= P_{pol}= \frac{N_+-N_-}{N_++N_-}=n_+-n_-
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
n_+&=\frac{N_+}{N_++N_-} \text{ and } n_- =\frac{N_-}{N_++N_-} \\
\Rightarrow n_+ &= \frac{1+P_{pol}}{2} \text{ and } n_- =\frac{1-P_{pol}}{2}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
$N_\pm$ are the number of incident neutrons with spin polarizations up ($+$) and down ($-$).
After switching on the spin flipper, which works with an efficiency of $\epsilon \in [0;1]$
($\epsilon=0$: flipper off, $\epsilon\lessapprox 1$ : flipper on), one gets
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
n_+(P_{pol},\epsilon) &= \epsilon \; \frac{1-P_{pol}}{2}+(1-\epsilon) \; \frac{1+P_{pol}}{2} \quad \text{ and } \\
n_-(P_{pol},\epsilon) &= \epsilon \; \frac{1+P_{pol}}{2}+(1-\epsilon) \; \frac{1-P_{pol}}{2}
\end{split}
\end{align}
The efficiency of the analyzer to filter spin up
($+$) or spin down ($-$) neutrons is given in case of an opaque spin filter by its transmission
$T_\pm(t) \in [0;1]$, which can be a function of time, so that the measured scattering cross section
$I_\text{m}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$ is given by

The spin dependent scattering intensities of magnetic particles with an orientation distribution
$f\left(\theta,\phi\right)$ of its magnetic moment can easily be calculated in terms of order
parameters $S_l$ if one assumes that the particle
are spherical symmetric or the orientation of the magnetic moment of a particle is not correlated to the
particle orientation. Furthermore it will be assumed that an external magnetic field is applied perpendicular
to the incident neutron beam and that all orientations $\phi$ for a given angle $\theta$, which is defined
as the angle between the magnetisation vector of the particle and the direction of the external field $\mbox{\boldmath$ B$}$
have the same probability, i.e. the orientation distribution only depends on $\theta$ so that
$f\left(\theta,\phi\right)=f\left(\theta\right)$. The orientation probability distribution function can be expanded
in terms of a complete set of orthogonal functions. Expanding it in terms of Legendre polynomials $P_l(\cos\theta)$ gives
\begin{align}
f(\theta) &= \sum_l c_l P_l(\cos\theta) = \sum_l \frac{2l+1}{2} S_l P_l(\cos\theta)
\end{align}
The expansion coefficients can be calculated by
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
c_l &= \frac{2l+1}{2} \int_0^\pi f(\theta)\, P_l(\cos\theta) \sin\theta \;\mathrm{d}\theta\\
\mbox{or} \\
S_l &= \int_0^\pi f(\theta) \, P_l(\cos\theta) \sin\theta\;\mathrm{d}\theta
\end{split}
\end{align}
The first three Legendre polynomials are defined by
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
P_0(\cos\theta) &= 1\\
P_1(\cos\theta) &= \cos\theta\ \\
P_2(\cos\theta) &= \frac{1}{2}\left(3\cos^2\theta-1\right)
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
For superparamagnetic particle the orientation probability distribution is given by
\begin{align}
f(\theta) = \frac{\alpha}{4\pi\sinh\alpha} \exp(\alpha\cos\theta)
\end{align}
with $\alpha=BM_pV_p/(k_BT)$ being the Langevin parameter. For this orientation probability distribution
the first order parameters can be calculates as
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:S_l_Boltzmann}
\begin{align}
S_0 & = 1 \\
S_1 & = L(\alpha) = \coth\alpha - \frac{1}{\alpha} \\
S_2 & = 1-3\frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The scattering from a system of many particles is obtained
by summing up the scattering amplitudes of all precipitates
weighted by the phase shift at each particle position.
In the decoupling approach scattering intensity is given by
\begin{align} \label{eq:I_ijSQ}
\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma_{{\pm\pm}\atop{\pm\mp}}}{\mathrm{d}\Omega}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) &=
N\left\{
\left\langle {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_{{\pm\pm}\atop{\pm\mp}}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2\right\rangle
+ {\left\vert \right\vert}{\left\langle F_{{\pm\pm}\atop{\pm\mp}}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})\right\rangle}^2 (S(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})-1)
\right\}
\end{align}
which consists of two terms. The first one depends only
on the particle structure and corresponds to the independent
scattering of $N$ particles, while the second one is also a
function of their statistical distribution and reflects the interparticle
interference, which is described by $S(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$. The $\langle\rangle$ indicates
an average over all possible configurations, sizes and orientations of the
magnetic moments of the particles. The spin dependent scattering amplitudes
$F_{{\pm\pm}\atop{\pm\mp}}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$ can be calculated from the nuclear and magnetic
amplitudes
\begin{align}
F_{\pm\pm}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) & = F_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \mp F_{M_\perp x}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \\
F_{\pm\mp}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) & = -\left(F_{M_\perp y}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \pm \imath F_{M_\perp z}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})\right)
\end{align}
The nuclear scattering amplitude is proportional to the nuclear excess scattering $\beta_N=F_N(Q=0)$
and the nuclear form factor $f_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$
\begin{align}
F_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) &= \beta_N f_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})
\end{align}
The magnetic scattering amplitude $\mbox{\boldmath$ F$}_{M_\perp}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$ can be described as a vector,
with
\begin{align}
\mbox{\boldmath$ F$}_{M_\perp}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) =  \mbox{\boldmath$ $}{\hat{\mu}}_\perp D_M \mu f_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})=\mbox{\boldmath$ $}{\hat{\mu}}_\perp F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})
\end{align}
where $f_M(Q)$ is the magnetic form factor, $\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}=\mbox{\boldmath$ M$}_pV_p$ the magnetic moment of the particle,
$D_M=\frac{\gamma e}{2\pi\hbar}$, and $\mbox{\boldmath$ $}{\hat{\mu}}_\perp$ the Halpern-Johnson vector defined as
\begin{align}
\mbox{\boldmath$ $}{\hat{\mu}}_\perp &= \frac{\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}}{Q}\times\left(\frac{\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}}{\mu}\times\frac{\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}}{Q}\right)
\end{align}
It is assumed here that the neutron spin polarization is parallel or antiparallel to the axes $\mbox{\boldmath$ e$}_x$
which is the direction perpendicular to the incoming neutron beam.
If only the Halpern-Johnson vector $\mbox{\boldmath$ $}{\hat{\mu}}_\perp$ depends on the orientation distribution $f(\theta)$ of the
magnetic moments $\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}$ of the particles but not the form factor $f_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$, which is valid
for spherical symmetric particles or anisotropic shaped particles where the particle shape is not
correlated to the direction of the magnetic moment, the averages in \ref{eq:I_ijSQ}
can be written in terms of the order parameters $S_1$ and $S_2$
\begin{subequations}
\label{eq:F_ijSQ}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
\left\langle F_{\pm\pm}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})\right\rangle &=  F_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) +F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})S_1\sin^2\psi
\end{split} \\[3mm]
\left\langle F_{\pm\mp}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})\right\rangle &= F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})S_1\sin\psi\cos\psi  \\[3mm]
\begin{split}
\left\langle {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_{\pm\pm}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2\right\rangle &= {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2+{\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2 \left[S_2 \sin^4\psi+ \frac{1-S_2}{3} \sin^2\psi\right] \\
                                       & \mp \left[F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})F^*_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})+F^*_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})F_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})\right]S_1\sin^2\psi
\end{split} \\[3mm]
\begin{split}
\left\langle {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_{\pm\mp}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2\right\rangle &={\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2 \left[2\;\frac{1-S_2}{3}-S_2\sin^4\psi+\frac{4S_2-1}{3}\sin^2\psi\right]
\end{split}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The spin-flip and spin-nonflip cross-section $\frac{\mathrm{d}\sigma_{{\pm\pm}\atop{\pm\mp}}}{\mathrm{d}\Omega}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$
can be obtained by combining \ref{eq:I_ijSQ} and \ref{eq:F_ijSQ}. The cross-sections
without polarization analysis $I_\pm(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$ and for unpolarized neutrons $I_{unp}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})$ are given by
\begin{subequations} \label{eq:I_iSQ_I_unpSQ}
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
    I_{\pm}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) &= I_{\pm\pm}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})+I_{\pm\mp}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \\[2mm]
                    &= \Bigl[{\left\vert \right\vert}{F_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2 + {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2S_1^2\sin^2\psi \\
                    & \quad  \mp \left[F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})F^*_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})+F^*_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})F_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})\right]S_1\sin^2\psi\Bigr] S(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \\
                    & \quad {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2\left(\frac{2}{3}\left(1-S_2\right)+\left(S_2-S_1^2\right)\sin^2\psi \right)
\end{split} \\[3mm]
\begin{split}
    I_{unp}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) &= \frac{1}{2}\left(I_{+}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})+I_{-}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})\right)\\[2mm]
                    &=  \left({\left\vert \right\vert}{F_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2 + {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2S_1^2\sin^2\psi\right) S(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \\
                    & \quad + {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2\left(\frac{2}{3}\left(1-S_2\right)+\left(S_2-S_1^2\right)\sin^2\psi\right)
\end{split}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}

In the case of a Boltzmann orientation distribution
$f(\theta)=\exp\left(\frac{\mbox{\boldmath$ B\mu$}}{k_BT}\right)=\exp\left(\frac{B\mu\cos\theta}{k_BT}\right)$
the order parameter $S_l$ already have been given in eq.\ \ref{eq:S_l_Boltzmann}
and the spin dependent intensities can be written as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{I_{\pm\pm}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}{N} &=
{\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) L(\alpha)\,\sin^2\psi
     \pm F_N(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2 S(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \\
&+
{\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2\, \left( \frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}\,
\sin^2\psi - \left( L^2(\alpha)-1+3\,\frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}\right)
\, \sin^4\psi \right)  \\
 \\
\frac{I_{\mp\pm}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}{N} &=
\left( \sin^2\psi - \sin^4\psi \right)
L^2(\alpha)
{\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2 S(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}) \\
&+
{\left\vert \right\vert}{F_M(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$})}^2  \left( \left( \sin^4\psi-\sin^2\psi \right)
\left( L^2(\alpha)-1+3\, \frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}\right) +
(2-\sin^2\psi)\, \frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}\right) 
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
$\psi$ is the angle between $\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$}$ and the horizontal axis in the plane of the detector.
$L(\alpha)=\coth(\alpha)-\frac{1}{\alpha}$ is the Langevin function. In the case of a static field
the superparamagnetic particle are thermodynamic equilibrium and $\alpha$ is given by
\begin{align}
\alpha&=\frac{BM_PV_P}{k_B T},
\end{align}
with $M_P$ being the particle magnetization, $V_P$ the particle volume,
$T$ the temperature in Kelvin and $k_B$ the Boltzmann constant.

In our experiments we applied an oscillating magnetic field to the sample described by:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
B(t,\nu;d_\text{SD},\lambda,\rho_0) &= B_1 - B_0
\cos(\phi(t,\nu);\dots) \\
\phi(t,\nu;d_\text{SD},\lambda,\rho_0) &=2\pi\nu(t-d_\text{SD}\lambda/3956)+\rho_0
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $t$ in [s] is the time between neutron detection and the trigger signal
from the frequency generator, $d_\text{SD}$ in [m] is the sample
detector distance, $\lambda $ in [\AA] the neutron wavelength, and
$\nu$ in [Hz] the frequency of the oscillating magnetic field. As
$t$ is defined here as the time of the neutron detection one has
therefore to correct the phase in the argument for the magnetic
field with an additional phase term. The term
$t_\text{SD}=d_\text{SD}\lambda/3956$ takes into account the flight
time $t_\text{SD}$ of the neutrons between the sample and the
detector. The term  $\rho_0$ accounts for any other
additional constant phase shift between trigger signal and the
magnetic field due to phase shifts in the amplifier.
If the neutron polarization can follow adiabatically the varying magnetic field needs to be verified
experimentally. Therefore we introduce here a parameter $a_\text{ad} \in [0;1]$ which takes into account
wether ($a_\text{ad}=1$) or not ($a_\text{ad}=0$) the neutron spin adiabatically follows the change
of of magnetic field direction ($\text{sgn}(B(t))$).
\begin{align}
\mbox{\boldmath$ r$}_\text{ad} =
\left(
  \begin{array}{c}
     a_\text{ad} \\
     (1-a_\text{ad}) \\
  \end{array}
\right)
\text{ and }
\mbox{\boldmath$ s$}_\text{ad} =
\left(
  \begin{array}{c}
     \text{sgn}(B(t)) \\
     1 \\
  \end{array}
\right)
\end{align}
The measured intensity than reads as
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
I_\text{m}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$},t) =&
\sum_{i=1,2} r_{ad,i} \Bigg[ \\
&\hspace{\breiteb} n_+\left(s_{ad,i}P_{pol},\epsilon\right)
                        A_+ I_{++}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$},t)
+                 n_+\left(s_{ad,i}P_{pol},\epsilon\right)
                        A_- I_{+-}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$},t)  \\
&+                 n_-\left(s_{ad,i}P_{pol},\epsilon\right)
                        A_- I_{--}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$},t)
+                 n_-\left(s_{ad,i}P_{pol},\epsilon\right)
                        A_+ I_{-+}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$},t)
\Bigg]   \\[3mm]
= &\sum_{i=1,2} \; \sum_{k,l=+,-}
r_{ad,i}\; n_k\left(s_{ad,i}P_{pol},\epsilon\right)\; A_l \; I_{kl}(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$},t)
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
\begin{split}
A_\pm &= \left(\frac{1+s_{ad,2}}{2}r_{ad,1} + \frac{1+s_{ad,1}}{2}r_{ad,2}\right) T_\pm(t) \\
    &+ \left(\frac{1-s_{ad,2}}{2}r_{ad,1} + \frac{1-s_{ad,1}}{2}r_{ad,2}\right) T_\mp(t)
\end{split}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
To calculate the time dependent scattering cross section a model for the time evolution of the
orientation distribution of the magnetic moments $f(\theta,t)$ is needed, from which the time
dependent order parameter $S_1(t)$ and $S_2(t)$ can be obtained, as well as a model for the
time evolution of the structure factor $S(\mbox{\boldmath$ Q$},t)$.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\frac{\mathrm{d}M}{\mathrm{d}t} &= -\frac{M(t)-M_\infty L(\alpha'(t))}{\tau} \\
M(t=0) &= M_0 \\
\alpha'(t) &= \alpha_0\cos(\omega t+\phi_0)+\alpha_1 \\
\alpha_0 &= \frac{-B_0\mu}{k_BT} \\
\alpha_1 &= \frac{B_1\mu}{k_BT} \\
\omega &= 2\pi\nu \\
\phi_0 &= \varphi_0 - \frac{\omega d_\text{SD}\lambda}{3956}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
In the limit of small values for the Langevin parameter $\alpha$ the Langevin function can be approximated
by
\begin{align}
    L(\alpha) \rightarrow \frac{\alpha}{3}
\end{align}
for which the differential equation has an analytical solution
\begin{align}
M(t) &= e^{-\frac {t}{\tau}} \left[ M_0- M_{\infty}\left(\frac{\alpha_0}{3}\;\frac{
\cos \left( \phi_0 \right) +\omega\tau\, \sin\left( \phi_0 \right) }{1+{\omega}^{2}{\tau^{2}}}
+\frac{\alpha_1}{3}\right)\right]  \\
&+M_\infty \left(\frac{\alpha_0}{3} \; \frac{\cos \left( \omega\,t+\phi_0 \right) +
\omega\tau\,\sin \left( \omega\,t+\phi_0 \right) }{1+\omega^2\tau^2}+\frac{\alpha_1}{3}\right) \\
&\underset{t\gg\tau}{\simeq}
M_\infty \left(\frac{\alpha_0}{3} \; \frac{\cos \left( \omega\,t+\phi_0 -\frac{\pi}{2}+\arcsin\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\omega^2\tau^2}}\right)\right) }{\sqrt{1+\omega^2\tau^2}}+\frac{\alpha_1}{3}\right)
\end{align}

Assuming that the system is at any time in thermodynamic equilibrium with the actual magnetic field $B(t)$
than the time dependent oscillating SANS signal can be described by simply  introducing a time dependent
value for $\alpha(t)$:
\begin{align}
\alpha(t,\lambda,d_\text{SD},\rho_0,\mu_\text{kT}) =
B(t,\lambda,d_\text{SD},\rho_0) \frac{M_PV_P}{k_B T} = B(\dots)\;
\mu_\text{kT}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
\mu_\text{kT} = \frac{M_PV_P}{k_B T}
\end{align}
In case that the magnetic moments can not follow the external magnetic field this could be described
by an additional phase $\Delta \phi_\alpha$ between $\alpha$ and $B$ and a damping factor $d_\alpha$ so that
\begin{align}
\alpha(t,\lambda,d_\text{SD},\rho_0-\Delta \phi_\alpha,\mu_\text{kT}) =
d_{\alpha} B(t,\lambda,d_\text{SD},\rho_0-\Delta \phi_\alpha) \frac{M_PV_P}{k_B T}.
\end{align}
In such a case of such
\begin{align}
\mbox{\boldmath$ r$}_\text{ad} =
\left(
  \begin{array}{c}
    (1-a_\text{ad}) \; \text{sgn}(B(t)) \\
    a_\text{ad} \; \text{sign}(B(t)\alpha(t))\\
  \end{array}
\right)
\end{align}
Furthermore we assume here that the size of the form factors
of the magnetic and nuclear scattering are the same except the
scattering contrast that means the ratio of magnetic to nuclear
form factor is $Q$-independent and equal to the squared ratio of
magnetic to nuclear scattering length density
\begin{equation}
\frac{F_N^2(Q)}{\tilde{F}_M^2(Q)}  = const = \left( \frac{\Delta
b_\text{nuc}}{\Delta b_\text{mag}}\right)^2
\end{equation}
Therefore the time
dependent signal on the detector for a given direction $\psi$ is given by
\begin{align}
 y(t,\dots) =
\int_{\lambda_0-\Delta\lambda}^{\lambda_0+\Delta\lambda}
    p_\triangle(\lambda) \;\; I_m(t,\lambda,\psi,\dots) \;\;  d\lambda
\end{align}
whereby $p_\triangle(\lambda)$ describes the triangular shaped
wave length distribution of the neutron beam.

The external applied field is given by: \begin{equation}
B(t,d_\text{SD},\lambda,\rho_0) = B_1 - B_0
\cos(2\pi\nu(t-d_\text{SD}\lambda/3956)+\rho_0) \end{equation} where $t$ in
[s] is the time between neutron detection and the trigger signal
from the frequency generator, $d_\text{SD}$ in [m] is the sample
detector distance, $\lambda $ in [\AA] the neutron wavelength, and
$\nu$ in [Hz] the frequency of the oscillating magnetic field. As
$t$ is defined here as the time of the neutron detection one has
therefore to correct the phase in the argument for the magnetic
field with an addition phase term. The term
$t_\text{SD}=d_\text{SD}\lambda/3956$ takes account for the flight
time $t_\text{SD}$ of the neutrons between the sample and the
detector. The term  $\rho_0$ takes account for any other
additional constant phase shift between trigger signal and the
magnetic field due to phase shifts in the amplifier.

The scattering intensity of superparamagnetic particles including a structure factor
$S(Q)$is given by
\begin{align}
I(Q) &= \underbrace{\tilde{F}_M^2(Q) \; 2
\frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha} + F_N^2(Q)S(Q)}_{\displaystyle A(Q)} \\
     &+ \underbrace{\tilde{F}_M^2(Q) \left[\left(1-3 \frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}-L^2(\alpha)\right)+L^2(\alpha)S(Q)\right]}_{\displaystyle B(Q)} \sin^2\Psi
     
\end{align}
Assuming that the system is in equilibrium faster than $1/\nu$
than the above equation can be used to describe the time dependent
oscillating SANS signal simply by introducing a time dependent
value for $\alpha$:
\begin{equation}
\alpha(t,\lambda,d_\text{SD},\rho_0,\mu_\text{kT}) =
B(t,\lambda,d_\text{SD},\rho_0) \frac{M_PV_P}{k_B T} = B(\dots)\;
\mu_\text{kT}
\end{equation}
with
\begin{equation}
\mu_\text{kT} = \frac{M_PV_P}{k_B T}
\end{equation}
Furthermore we assume here that the size of the form factors
of the magnetic and nuclear scattering are the same except the
scattering contrast that means the ratio of magnetic to nuclear
form factor is $Q$-independent and equal to the squared ratio of
magnetic to nuclear scattering length density
\begin{equation}
\frac{F_N^2(Q)}{\tilde{F}_M^2(Q)}  = const = \left( \frac{\Delta
b_\text{nuc}}{\Delta b_\text{mag}}\right)^2
\end{equation}
Therefore the time
dependent signal on the detector for a given direction $\Psi$ and
integrated over $Q$ in this direction is given by
\begin{align}
i(t,\dots)
    &= \int_{Q_\text{min}}^{Q_\text{min}} I(Q,t,\lambda,\Psi,d_\text{SD},\rho_0) dQ  \\
    &= c\left[2\frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}
              + \frac{F_N^2(Q)}{\tilde{F}_M^2(Q)} S(Q)
              + \left[\left(1-3 \frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}-L^2(\alpha)\right)+L^2(\alpha)S(Q)\right]\sin^2\Psi\right]  \\
    &= c\left[2\frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}
              + \left( \frac{\Delta b_\text{nuc}}{\Delta b_\text{mag}}\right)^2 S(Q)
              + \left[\left(1-3 \frac{L(\alpha)}{\alpha}-L^2(\alpha)\right)+L^2(\alpha)S(Q)\right]\sin^2\Psi\right] 
\end{align}
\begin{equation} y(t,\dots) =
\int_{\lambda_0-\Delta\lambda}^{\lambda_0+\Delta\lambda}
    p_\triangle(\lambda) \;\; i(t,\lambda,\Psi,d_\text{SD},\rho_0) \;\;  d\lambda
\end{equation} whereby $p_\triangle(\lambda)$ describes the triangular shaped
wave length distribution of the neutron beam.

\section{Methods to include structure factors}
For each scattering object $i$ next to a size distribution $N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i)$ also a
structure factor $S_i(Q;{\underline{ s}}_i)$ can be included. When a structure factor is included
several theoretical ways to account for it have been implemented
like the monodisperse approximation (\ref{sec:SQmonodisperse}),
decoupling approach (\ref{sec:SQdecoupling}),
local monodisperse approximation (\ref{sec:SQlocalmonodisperse}),
partial structure factor (\ref{sec:SQpartial})
and scaling approximation of partial structure factors (\ref{sec:SQscaling}).
At the moment it is assumed that there are no interactions between different species
of scatterers so that the total scattering is given by the sum of the scattering of the
individual species
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}(Q) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^N \frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q)
\end{equation}
whereby different approaches to include structure factor effects in
the differential scattering cross-sections $\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q)$
of the species $i$ of scatterer are defined below.
\subsection{Monodisperse approach}
\label{sec:SQmonodisperse}
~\\
The monodisperse approach is the simplest way to include a structure factor in the analysis.
This approach simply multiplies the size averaged form factor with the structure factor.
Here it is assumed that the interaction potential between particles are spherical symmetric
and independent of the particle size.
\begin{equation} \frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) = \left[
\int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i)
F_i^2(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x) dx \right] S_i(Q;{\underline{ s}}_i)
\end{equation}
\subsection{Decoupling approximation}
\label{sec:SQdecoupling}
~\\
For systems with small polydispersities and small anisotropies leads to a
decoupling approach of Kotlarchyk and Chen \cite{Kotlarchyk1983}. It is assumed that interactions
are independent of particle size and orientation.
\begin{align}
\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) = &
\int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i) F_i^2(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x) dx
+  \frac{1}{n_i}\left[\int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i)
F_i(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x) dx\right]^2   \\
\times & \left[S_i(Q;{\underline{ s}}_i)-1\right]
\end{align}
with
\begin{equation}
n_i = \int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i)  dx.
\label{eq:ni}
\end{equation}
The decoupling approximation can only be combined with those form factor,
for which the scattering amplitude $F_i(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x)$ has been implemented.
However, for many form factors only the scattering intensity $F_i^2(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x)$ is
available. The combination of those form factors with the decoupling approach produces
an error message in {\tt SASfit }.
\subsection{Local monodisperse approximation}
\label{sec:SQlocalmonodisperse}
~\\
The opposite limit of the approximations as used for the
decoupling approximation is used in the local monodisperse
approximation \cite{Pedersen1994}. In this approach it is assumed
that a particle of a certain size is always surrounded by
particles with the same size. Following this the scattering is
approximated by that of monodisperse sub-systems weighted by the
size distribution:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) =
\int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i)
F_i^2(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x) S_i(Q;{\underline{ s}}_i,R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x)) dx
\end{equation}
in which it has been indicated that the structure factor is for particles of size
$R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x)$. As the distribution $N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i)$ does not necessarily describe the
distribution of the overall size. {\tt SASfit } assumes, that the radius of a particle
with the form factor $F_i(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x)$ used in the structure factor is given
by the radius of a sphere with the same volume $V_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x)$
\begin{equation}
R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x) = \sqrt[3]{\frac{3}{4 \pi}V_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x)}.
\label{eq:Ri}
\end{equation}
This local monodisperse approximation works better than the decoupling approximation for
systems with larger polydispersities and higher concentrations. As
compared to the decoupling approximation and the scaling
approximation described below, it has the advantage that the cross
section is linear in the size distribution.
\subsection{partial structure factors}
\label{sec:SQpartial}
~\\
For polydisperse systems it is also not possible to write the scattering cross section as a
product of a form factor and a structure factor. The scattering cross section has the form
\begin{align}
\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) =
&\int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i) F_i^2(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x) dx \\
+ & \frac{1}{n_i}\int_0^\infty\int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i)N_i(x';{\underline{ l}}_i)F_i(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x)F_i(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x')  \\
\times & \left[S_i(Q;{\underline{ s}}_i,R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x),R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x'))-1\right] dx dx' 
\end{align}
where monodisperse structure factor $S_i(Q;{\underline{ s}}_i,\dots)$
is evaluated for the radius
$(R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x)+R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x'))/2$. $n_i$ and $R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x)$ have the same
definition as those in eq.\ \ref{eq:ni} and \ref{eq:Ri}.
\subsection{Scaling approximation}
\label{sec:SQscaling}
~\\
A scaling approximation has recently been introduced by Gazzillo
et al. \cite{Gazzillo1999}. It is assumed that the pair correlation functions
are identical except for a scaling constant. This leads to the
following expression:
\begin{align}
\frac{d\sigma_i}{d\Omega}(Q) =
 &\int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i) F_i^2(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x) dx \\
+ & \frac{1}{n_i}\int_0^\infty\int_0^\infty
N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i) N_i(x';{\underline{ l}}_i) F_i(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x) F_i(Q;{\underline{ a}}_i,x')  \\
\times & \frac{V_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x)+V_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x')}{2V_{i,av}}
\left[S_i(Q;{\underline{ s}}_i,R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x),R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x'))-1\right]
\;dx dx' 
\end{align}
where $V_{i,av}$ is given by
\begin{equation}
V_{i,av} = \frac{\int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i) V_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x) dx}{\int_0^\infty N_i(x;{\underline{ l}}_i) dx}
\end{equation}
and the monodisperse structure factor is evaluated for the radius
$(R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x)+R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x'))/2$. $n_i$ and $R_i({\underline{ a}}_i,x)$ have the same
definition as those in eq.\ \ref{eq:ni} and \ref{eq:Ri}.
Note that the expression is not linear in the size distribution
and that it involves double integrations, which makes least-square
fitting with this expression relatively slow.

\section{Multi Lamellar Structures \cite{Pabst2003,Fruhwirth2004}}
\subsection{Multi-Lamellar Structures, Thermal Disorder} \hspace{1pt}\\

\includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth,height=0.4\textwidth]{ThermalDisorderSQ.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Thermal disorder, considering fluctuations of flat layers
around well defined and evenly spaced equilibrium positions.}
\label{ThermalDisorderSQ}
\end{figure}
The first type describes thermal disorder (TD) caused by small
fluctuations of the bilayers around well defined mean layer
positions of equal separation (Fig. \ref{ThermalDisorderSQ}). In
such a crystal lattice the long-range order is preserved and the
structure factor for a single domain of size $L = Nd$ is identical
to that of a perfect finite crystal multiplied by the well known
Debye-Waller temperature factor, where $\Delta = \left<
(d_k-d)^2\right>$ denotes the mean square fluctuations of the
bilayers. As shown in Fig. \ref{ThermalDisorderSQ},
$S_\text{TD}(Q)$ is characterized by a set of Bragg peaks of equal
width, the diffraction order amplitudes of which decrease
exponentially with the Debye-Waller factor. The lost intensity is
found as a diffuse background scattering, which increases to the
limit of $N$ for large $Q$.
\begin{align}
S_\text{TD}(Q,N,d,\Delta,N_\text{diff}) = N_\text{diff} + \sum_{N_k=N-2\sigma}^{N+2\sigma} x_k
S_\text{k,TD}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
S_\text{k,TD} & = \left( N_k + 2 \exp\left(
-\frac{Q^2\Delta^2}{2}\right) \sum_{m=1}^{N_k-1} (N_k-m) \cos(mQd)
\right)
\end{align}
$N_\text{diff}$ accounts for an additional
diffuse background, due to a number of uncorrelated
scattering bilayers in $S_\text{TD}(Q,N,d,\Delta,N_\text{diff})$,
which is not included in the TD theory.
Its origin is attributed to bilayers with strong lattice defects or
unilamellar vesicles, which display neither short-range nor
(quasi-) long-range order.
The structure factors $S_\text{k,TD}(Q)$ with low, but fixed
stacking numbers $N$ show oscillations at low $Q$ (as can be seen in
Fig. \ref{ThermalDisorderSQ}), but no such oscillations are found in
experimental data. This can be understood as the consequence of
polydispersity in the size of the different stacks. In order to
eliminate these artifacts from strictly monodisperse systems, we use
a `polydisperse' structure factor, i.e. we use an average of a
series of structure factors with varying numbers of bilayers
\cite{Fruhwirth2004}. The analytical form of the distribution is not
known a priori. We use a Gaussian distribution approximated by a
discrete series The standard deviation $\sigma$ for the
Gaussian-weighted distribution is chosen as
\begin{align}
\sigma =
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{N} & \text{for} N\geq 5 \text{,} \\
0.5(N-1) & \text{for} N< 5
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Therefore, $N$ must be greater or equal to 2, which is a
reasonable restriction for multilamellar stacks of bilayers. In
the range of $N \pm 2\sigma$, structure factors weighted by
\begin{align}
x_k & = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left[
-\frac{(N_k-N)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]
\end{align}
are calculated, where $N$ is the mean number of stacks and $N_k$
is one of the  bilayers in the range $N\pm 2\sigma$. This
polydispersity model does not introduce new free parameters and is
symmetrical around the mean $N$.

\caption{Stacking disorder as described within paracrystalline
theory (PT) is due to displacements from the mean layer

\end{figure}
The second type of disorder accounts for the presence of small
variations in the bilayer separations (Fig.
\ref{ParacrystallineTheorySQ}), so-called stacking disorder, and is
described within the paracrystalline theory (PT)
\cite{Hosemann1962,Guinier1963,Blaurock1982}. As the position of an
individual fluctuating layer in a paracrystal is determined solely
by its nearestneighbour membranes, the crystalline long-range order
is lost. Still, we are able to observe Bragg-peak scattering due to
the fact that there is quasi long-range order. However, these
quasi-Bragg peaks will display a typical line shape. In the case of
disorder of the second kind, the structure factor derived from
paracrystalline theory is given by \cite{Guinier1963}
\begin{align}
S_\text{PT}(Q,N,d,\Delta,N_\text{diff}+) = N_\text{diff}+\sum_{N_k=N-2\sigma}^{N+2\sigma} x_k
S_\text{k,PT}

S_\text{k,PT} &= \left( N_k + 2 \sum_{m=1}^{N_k-1} (N_k-m)
\cos(mQd) \exp\left( -\frac{m^2Q^2\Delta^2}{2}\right) \right)
\end{align}
$N_\text{diff}$ accounts for an additional
diffuse background, due to a number of uncorrelated
scattering bilayers in $S_\text{PT}(Q,N,d,\Delta,N_\text{diff})$,
which is not included in the paracrystalline theory.
Its origin is attributed to bilayers with strong lattice defects or
unilamellar vesicles, which display neither short-range nor
(quasi-) long-range order.
Fig. \ref{ParacrystallineTheorySQ} shows that the quasi-Bragg peak
intensity decreases for $S_\text{PT}(Q)$, as in the previous case of
thermal disorder. However, the decrease in peak height is also
accompanied by a progressive broadening proportional to the square
of the diffraction order $h$ \cite{Schwartz1975}. The line shape of
the tails is essentially Lorentzian with
$$S_\text{k,PT}(Q) \propto (Q - Q_h)^2,$$
where $Q_h$ is the position of the $h^\text{th}$ diffraction order
in $Q$ space. Again, the loss in intensity shows up as diffuse
background scattering, which is stronger than from pure thermal
disorder.
The structure factors $S_\text{k,PT}(Q)$ with low, but fixed
stacking numbers $N$ show oscillations at low $Q$ (as can be seen in
Fig. \ref{ParacrystallineTheorySQ}), but no such oscillations are
found in experimental data. This can be understood as the
consequence of polydispersity in the size of the different stacks.
In order to eliminate these artifacts from strictly monodisperse
systems, we use a `polydisperse' structure factor, i.e. we use an
average of a series of structure factors with varying numbers of
bilayers \cite{Fruhwirth2004}. The analytical form of the
distribution is not known a priori. We use a Gaussian distribution
approximated by a discrete series The standard deviation $\sigma$
for the Gaussian-weighted distribution is chosen as
\begin{align}
\sigma =
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{N} & \text{for} N\geq 5 \text{,} \\
0.5(N-1) & \text{for} N< 5
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Therefore, $N$ must be greater or equal to 2, which is a
reasonable restriction for multilamellar stacks of bilayers. In
the range of $N \pm 2\sigma$, structure factors weighted by
\begin{align}
x_k & = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left[
-\frac{(N_k-N)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]
\end{align}
are calculated, where $N$ is the mean number of stacks and $N_k$
is one of the  bilayers in the range $N\pm 2\sigma$. This
polydispersity model does not introduce new free parameters and is
symmetrical around the mean $N$.

\caption{Bending fluctuation disorder is a particular feature of

\label{ModifiedCailleTheorySQ}
\end{figure}
There is another type of disorder when bilayer bending fluctuations
are considered (Fig. \ref{ModifiedCailleTheorySQ}). Such
fluctuations are particularly pronounced in the fluid $L_\alpha$
phase (equivalent to smectic A). Caill\'e Bending fluctuation
disorder is a particular feature of the $L_\alpha$ (smectic A) phase
and is caused by bilayer undulations. The particular shape of the
Bragg peaks is given by the modified Caill\'e theory (MCT).
\cite{Caille1972} realized the impact on the structure factor, which
in a modified version \cite{Zhang1994} of the Caill\'e theory (MCT)
is
\begin{align}
S_\text{MC}(Q,N,d,\eta_1,\gamma, N_\text{diff}) = N_\text{diff}+
\sum_{N_k=N-2\sigma}^{N+2\sigma} x_k S_\text{k,MC}
\end{align}
with
\begin{align}
S_\text{k,MC} = N_k + 2 \sum_{m=1}^{N_k-1} (N_k-m) \cos(mQd) \,\,
e^{ -\left(\frac{d}{2\pi}\right)^2 Q^2 \eta_1 \gamma } \,\, (\pi
m)^{-(d/2\pi)^2Q^2\eta_1}
\end{align}
Here, $\gamma$ is Euler's constant and
$$ \eta = \pi k_B T / 2d^2(BK_c)^{1/2}$$
is the Caill\'e parameter, which is a measure for the bilayer
fluctuations and is inversely proportional to the square root of the
bilayer bending rigidity $K_c$ times the bulk modulus of compression
$B$ (De Gennes \& Prost, 1993). Therefore, a lineshape analysis of
the quasi-Bragg peaks opens an important experimental window on
interbilayer interactions. Further, $K_c$ and $B$ can be decoupled
as demonstrated recently by hydration studies
\cite{Petrache1998,Pabst2003}, or more elegantly by measuring
multibilayers aligned on a solid substrate \cite{Lyatskaya2000}.
$N_\text{diff}$ accounts for an additional diffuse background, due
to a number of uncorrelated scattering bilayers in
$S_\text{MC}(Q,N,d,\eta_1,\gamma, N_\text{diff}) $, which is not
included in the MCT. Its origin is attributed to bilayers with
strong lattice defects or unilamellar vesicles, which display
neither short-range nor (quasi-) long-range order.
Fig. \ref{ModifiedCailleTheorySQ} shows a typical example of
$S_\text{k,MCT}(Q)$, which is similar to $S_\text{PT}(Q)$ with
respect to the progressive decrease in peak height and increase in
peak width, but which differs significantly in line shape as
$$
S_\text{k,MCT} \propto (Q-Q_h)^{-1+\eta h^2}
$$
for randomly oriented scattering domains \cite{Roux1988,Zhang1994}.
The structure factors $S_\text{k,MCT}(Q)$ with low, but fixed
stacking numbers $N$ show oscillations at low $Q$ (as can be seen in
Fig. \ref{ModifiedCailleTheorySQ}), but no such oscillations are
found in experimental data. This can be understood as the
consequence of polydispersity in the size of the different stacks.
In order to eliminate these artifacts from strictly monodisperse
systems, we use a `polydisperse' structure factor, i.e. we use an
average of a series of structure factors with varying numbers of
bilayers \cite{Fruhwirth2004}. The analytical form of the
distribution is not known a priori. We use a Gaussian distribution
approximated by a discrete series The standard deviation $\sigma$
for the Gaussian-weighted distribution is chosen as
\begin{align}
\sigma =
\begin{cases}
\sqrt{N} & \text{for} N\geq 5 \text{,} \\
0.5(N-1) & \text{for} N< 5
\end{cases}
\end{align}
Therefore, $N$ must be greater or equal to 2, which is a
reasonable restriction for multilamellar stacks of bilayers. In
the range of $N \pm 2\sigma$, structure factors weighted by
\begin{align}
x_k & = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left[
-\frac{(N_k-N)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right]
\end{align}
are calculated, where $N$ is the mean number of stacks and $N_k$
is one of the  bilayers in the range $N\pm 2\sigma$. This
polydispersity model does not introduce new free parameters and is
symmetrical around the mean $N$.

\section{Mass Fractal}~\\
\label{sect:SQ4clusteraggregates}
For a fractal object, the structure factor $S(q)$ can be calculated
\cite{Sorensen1999,Sorensen1992} via
the pair correlation function $g(r)$, which describes the total number of
particles within a sphere of radius $r$ centered in a central
particle and is given (for $\dim = 3$) by
\begin{align}
N(r) = \Phi \int_0^r g(r) \, 4\pi r^2 \, dr
\end{align}
or
\begin{align}
\textrm{d}N(r) = \Phi  g(r) \, 4\pi r^2 \, dr \label{eq:fractdN}
\end{align}
On the other hand, a fractal object is characterized by a spatial
distribution of the individual scatterers given by
\begin{align}
N(r) = \left( \frac{r}{r_0} \right)^D \label{eq:fractN}
\end{align}
where $r_0$ is the gauge of the measurement, which has
the magnitude of the characteristic dimension of each
individual scatterer.
Differentiation of \ref{eq:fractN} and identification with \ref{eq:fractdN}
gives
\begin{align}
\Phi g(r) = \frac{D}{4\pi r_0^D} r^{D-3}
\end{align}
Because $D$ is smaller than 3, $g(r)$ goes to zero at
large $r$. This is clearly unphysical.
At some large scale, the sample will show a
macroscopic density. A good knowledge of the sample
allows in general a reasonable assumption for the
large-scale behavior of $g(r)$. Therefore a cut-off function
$h(r,\xi)$ has to be introduced, where $\xi$ is a cut-off distance, to
describe the behavior of the pair correlation function
at large distances. To derive the analytical form of
$S(q)$ within this assumption, one can use the general
theory of liquids, where the uniform density is subtracted
to avoid a divergence in the evaluation of $S(q)$.
We then write
\begin{align}
4\pi\Phi[g(r)-1] = \frac{D}{r_0^D} \, r^{D-3} h(r,\xi)
\label{eq:fract_g(r)-1}
\end{align}
The meaning of $\xi$ is only qualitative and has to be
made precise in any particular situation. Generally
speaking, it represents the characteristic distance
above which the mass distribution in the sample is no
longer described by the fractal law. In practice, it can
represent the size of an aggregate or a correlation
length in a disordered material.
For isotropic systems
\begin{align}
S(q) = 1+4\pi\Phi\int_0^\infty [g(r)-1] \frac{\sin(qr)}{qr} \, r^2 \, dr
\end{align}
Combined with \ref{eq:fract_g(r)-1} one gets
\begin{align}
S(q) = 1 +\frac{D}{r_0^D} \int_0^\infty r^{D-3} h(r,\xi)  \frac{\sin(qr)}{qr}\, r^2 \, dr
\label{eq:hSQ}
\end{align}
Several cut-off functions $h(r,\xi)$ have been discussed in the
literature and compared by Sorensen et al.\
\cite{Sorensen1999,Sorensen1992}.
\begin{align}
h_\text{Exp}(r,\xi)     &= \exp\left[-\tfrac{r}{\xi}\right] \label{eq:hExp}\\
h_\text{Gauss}(r,\xi)   &= \exp\left[-\left(\tfrac{r}{\xi}\right)^2\right] \label{eq:hGauss}\\
h_\text{Exp(-x$\hat{~}$a)}(r,\xi,\alpha,D) &= \exp\left[-\left(\tfrac{r}{\xi}\right)^\alpha\right] \label{eq:hExpmxa}\\
h_\text{OverlapSph}(r,\xi)   &=
\begin{cases}
\left(1+\frac{r}{4\xi}\right)\left(1-\frac{r}{2\xi}\right)^2
& \text{for } r\leq 2\xi \\
0 & \text{for } r>2\xi
\end{cases}
\label{eq:hOverlapSph}
\end{align}
For the cut-off functions \ref{eq:hExp} and \ref{eq:hGauss} the integral \ref{eq:hSQ} can be solved
analytically and the corresponding structure factors are given by
\begin{align}
S_\text{Exp}(q,\xi,D,r_0) &= 1 +  \cfrac{D \Gamma(D-1)
\sin\left([D-1]\arctan(q \xi)\right)}{\left( q r_0\right)^D
\left[1+\tfrac{1}{q^2\xi^2}\right]^{(D-1)/2}} \\
S_\text{Gauss}(q,\xi,D,r_0) &= 1 +
    \Gamma\left[\tfrac{D}{2}\right]\frac{D}{2}
    \left(\frac{\xi}{r_0}\right)^D
    {}_1F_1\left[\tfrac{D}{2},\tfrac{3}{2},-\tfrac{q^2\xi^2}{8}\right]
\end{align}
where $D$ is the fractal dimension, $\xi$ is a cut-off length for
the fractal correlations, $\Gamma(x)$ is the gamma function.
${}_1F_1\left[\right]$ is the Kummer or hypergeometric function. For
the cut-off functions \ref{eq:hExpmxa} and \ref{eq:hOverlapSph} the
integral \ref{eq:hSQ} is solved numerically.

this allows for inclusion of the interparticle interference effects due to screened
coulomb repulsion between charged particles.
The salt concentration, is used to compute the ionic strength of the solution which
in turn is used to compute the Debye screening length. At present there is no provision
for entering the ionic strength directly nor for use of any multivalent salts. The

\subsection{Voigt Peak} ~\\
In spectroscopy, the Voigt profile is a spectral line profile
named after Woldemar Voigt and found in all branches of
spectroscopy in which a spectral line is broadened by two types of
mechanisms, one of which alone would produce a Doppler profile,
and the other of which would produce a Lorentzian profile. All
normalized line profiles can be considered to be probability
distributions. The Doppler profile is essentially a normal
distribution and a Lorentzian profile is essentially a Cauchy
distribution. Without loss of generality, we can consider only
centered profiles which peak at zero. The Voigt profile is then
the convolution of a Lorentzian profile and a Doppler profile:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
V(x\vert\sigma,\gamma)& = \int_\infty^\infty D(x'\vert\sigma) \,
                                            L(x-x'\vert\gamma)\, dx'
\end{align}
where $x$ is frequency from line center, $D(x\vert\sigma)$ is the
centered Doppler profile:
\begin{align}
D(x\vert\sigma) & = \frac{e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2}}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}
\end{align}
and $L(x\vert\gamma)$ is the centered Lorentzian profile:
\begin{align}
L(x\vert\gamma) & = \frac{\gamma}{\pi(x^2+\gamma^2)} .
\end{align}
The defining integral can be evaluated as:
\begin{align}
V(x) & = \frac{\Re[w(z)]}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}
\end{align}
where $\Re[w(z)]$ is the real part of the complex error function
of $z$ and

z = \frac{x+i\gamma}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}

\section{PearsonIII distribution}

The Pearson distribution is a family of probability distributions
that are a generalisation of the normal distribution. The Pearson
Type III distribution is given by the probability density function
\begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{1}{\beta\,\Gamma(p)} \left(\frac{x-\alpha}{\beta}\right)^{p-1} e^{-(x-\alpha)/\beta}, \!
\end{equation} where $x \in [\alpha,\infty)$ and $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $p$
are parameters of the distribution with $\beta > 0$ and $p > 0$
(Abramowitz and Stegun 1954, p. 930). Here, $\Gamma ()$ denotes
the Gamma function.
\begin{itemize}
\item Mean:
$$
    \alpha + p\beta
$$
\item Variance:
$$
    p\beta^2
$$
\item Skewness:
$$
    \frac{2}{\sqrt{p}}
$$
\item Kurtosis:
$$
    \frac{6}{p}
$$
\end{itemize}
The Pearson Type III distribution is identical to the Gamma
distribution (\ref{GammaSDEq}). When $\alpha=0$, $\beta=2$, and
$p$ is half-integer, the Pearson Type III distribution becomes the
$\chi^2$ distribution of $2p$ degrees of freedom.

\item Weibull or type III extreme value distribution

$$
where $\xi > 0$ and $\xi > 0$

Remark I: For reliability issues the Weibull dist ribution is used
with the variable $t = \mu - x$, the time, which is strictly
positive. Thus the support is positive - in contrast to the use in
extreme value theory.

Remark II: Be aware of an important distinctive feature of the
three extreme value distributions: The support is either
unlimited, or it has an upper or lower limit.

\section{Beta} \hspace{1pt}
\label{sec:Beta}
The Beta distribution is a very versatile function which can be
used to model several different shapes of probability density curves.
In probability theory and statistics, the beta distribution is a
family of continuous probability distributions defined on the
interval $[0, 1]$ parameterized by two positive shape parameters,
typically denoted by $\alpha$ and $\beta$.
\begin{equation}
p_\mathrm{Beta}(x;\alpha,\beta) =
\begin{cases}
 \frac{1}{\mathrm{B}(\alpha,\beta)}\, x ^{\alpha-1}(1-x)^{\beta-1} & \mbox{ for } 0<x<1  \\
0   & \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
\end{equation}
The beta function, B, appears as a normalization constant to ensure that the total
probability integrates to unity. $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are positive numbers that
define the shape parameters. The mode of the beta distribution for shape parameters
$\alpha>1$ and $\beta>1$ is given by
\begin{equation}
\text{mode}\left(p_\mathrm{Beta}\right) = \frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+\beta-2}

\section{Chi-Squared} \hspace{1pt} \\
\label{sec:ChiSquared}
\footnote{\href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_distribution}{Description
taken partly from Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia}}In probability
theory and statistics, the chi-square distribution (also chi-squared
or $\xi^2$  distribution) is one of the most widely used theoretical
probability distributions in inferential statistics, e.g., in
statistical significance tests. It is useful because, under
reasonable assumptions, easily calculated quantities can be proven
to have distributions that approximate to the chi-square
distribution if the null hypothesis is true.

The best-known situations in which the chi-square distribution are
used are the common chi-square tests for goodness of fit of an observed
distribution to a theoretical one, and of the independence of two criteria
of classification of qualitative data. Many other statistical tests also
lead to a use of this distribution, like Friedman's analysis of variance by ranks.


A probability density function of the chi-square distribution is
\begin{equation}
    f(x;k)= \begin{cases}\displaystyle \frac{1}{2^{k/2}\Gamma(k/2)}\,x^{(k/2) - 1} e^{-x/2}&\text{for }x>0\\
                            0&\text{for }x\le 0
            \end{cases}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma$ denotes the Gamma function, which has closed-form values at the half-integers.
The mode of the distribution is
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{mode} = k-2\, \mbox{ if }\, k\geq 2.
\end{equation}
The $\chi^2$ distribution is a special case of the gamma distribution \ref{sec:GammaDistr}
where $\theta = 2$ in the equation \ref{eq:GammaDistr}.

\subsection{Chi-Squared (Amplitude)} \hspace{1pt} \\

z &= \frac{x-x_x}{\sigma} \\

The standard statistical form has been reparameterized. The parameter $x_c$ has been added
to enable variable $x$ positioning, and $\sigma$ to enable scaling. The mode is $x_c$.
The function returns 0 for those x where it is undefined $(z+u<0)$.

\section{F-Variance} ~\\
\label{sec:FVariance}

In probability theory and statistics, the
F-distribution is a continuous probability distribution. It is also
known as Snedecor's F distribution or the Fisher-Snedecor
distribution. The probability density is given by
\begin{equation}
p_\mathrm{F-var}(x,\nu_1,\nu_2) =
\frac{\displaystyle \sqrt{\frac{\left(\nu_1 x\right)^{\nu_1} \nu_2^{\nu_2}}{\left(\nu_1 x+\nu_2\right)^{\nu_1+\nu_2}}}}{x\,\mathrm{B}\left(\frac{\nu_1}{2},\frac{\nu_2}{2}\right)}
\end{equation}
for real $x\geq 0$, where $\nu>1$ and $\nu_2$ are positive,
and $\mathrm{B}()$  is the beta function.
For $\nu_1>2$ the mode of the distribution is defined by
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{mode}_F(\nu_1,\nu_2)=\frac{\nu_1-2}{\nu_1}\frac{\nu_2}{\nu_2+2}
\end{equation}

The amplitude version represents a re-parametrization of the standard statistical form.

c_0+a\,\frac{p_\mathrm{F-var}(z,\nu_1,\nu_2)}{p_\mathrm{F-var}(\mathrm{mode}_F(\nu_1,\nu_2),\nu_1,\nu_2)}  & \mbox{ for } z>0\\

The location parameter $x_c$ has been added to enable variable $x$ positioning, and $\sigma$
to enable scaling. The mode of the distribution function is $x_c$ due to the additional term
$\frac{\nu_1-2}{\nu_1}\frac{\nu_2}{\nu_2+2}$ in the definition of $z$. The distribution
function returns the offset $c_0$ for values $z\leq 0$.

\section{Gamma}
\label{sec:GammaDistr}
The gamma distribution models sums of exponentially distributed random variables.

The gamma distribution family is based on two parameters. The
chi-square and exponential distributions, which are children of the
gamma distribution, are one-parameter distributions that fix one of
the two gamma parameters. The standard form is given by
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:GammaDistr}
p(x;k,\theta) = x^{k-1} \frac{e^{-x/\theta}}{\theta^k
\, \Gamma(k)} \ \mathrm{ for }\ x > 0\,\, \mathrm{ and }\,\, k,
\theta > 0.
\end{equation}
When $k$ is large, the gamma distribution closely approximates a
normal distribution with the advantage that the gamma distribution
has density only for positive real numbers.
In probability theory and statistics, the gamma distribution is a
two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions.
It has a scale parameter $\theta$ and a shape parameter $k$. If $k$
is an integer then the distribution represents the sum of $k$ independent
exponentially distributed random variables, each of which has a mean of
$\theta$ (which is equivalent to a rate parameter of $\theta^{-1}$).


Alternatively, the gamma distribution can be parameterized
in terms of a shape parameter $\alpha = k$ and an inverse scale
parameter $\beta = 1/\theta$, called a rate parameter:
\begin{equation}
p(x;\alpha,\beta) = x^{\alpha-1} \frac{\beta^{\alpha} \,
e^{-\beta\,x} }{\Gamma(\alpha)} \ \mathrm{for}\ x > 0 \,\!.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Gamma (Amplitude)} ~\\

  The parameter $x_c$ has been added to enable variable $x$ positioning,
  whereas the $+\theta(k-1)$ adjusts $x_c$ so that it represents the mode.

  The function returns the offset $c_0$ for those $x$ where it is undefined

  \begin{equation}
   y(x) = \Bigg\{
   \begin{array}{ll}
       c_0 + a \exp(-z) \left(\frac{z+k-1}{k-1}\right)^{k-1} & \mbox{for } (z+k-1) > 0 \\

\section{generalized Gaussian 1} ~\\
\label{sec:generalizedGaussian1}

The generalized Gaussian distribution is one of two families of
continuous probability distributions, which has an additional shape
parameter to the normal distribution. Known also as the exponential
power distribution, or the generalized error distribution, this is a
parametric family of symmetric distributions. It includes all normal
and Laplace distributions, and as limiting cases it includes all
continuous uniform distributions on bounded intervals of the real
line.

This family includes the normal distribution when $\beta=2$ (with
mean $\mu$ and variance $\frac{\alpha^2}{2}$) and it includes the
Laplace distribution when $\beta=1$. As $\beta\rightarrow\infty$,
the density converges pointwise to a uniform density on $
(\mu-\alpha,\mu+\alpha)$.

The \texttt{Half Gaussian Modified Gaussian (Area)} is the mathematical
convolution of a Gaussian with a half-Gaussian response function. There are only two
components to this model, a primary Gaussian, and a response function
which convolves or smears the Gaussian as in the profiles above. As the
width of the half-Gaussian response increases, peaks become more
asymmetric or tailed. This function directly fit both tailed and fronted peaks. The transition from
tailed to smooth is continuous and occurs at $\delta=0$. The formula has been taken from the
Manual of the Peakfit Software package (SeaSolve Software Inc.).

\section{Inverted Gamma}
\label{sec:InvertedGamma}

The inverse gamma distribution is a two-parameter family of
continuous probability distributions on the positive real line,
which is the distribution of the reciprocal of a variable
distributed according to the gamma distribution. The inverse gamma
distribution's probability density function is defined over the
support $x > 0$. The probability density function is given by
\begin{align}
p(x) &= \frac{\beta^\alpha}{\Gamma(\alpha)} x^{-\alpha - 1} \exp
\left(\frac{-\beta}{x}\right)
\end{align}
the mode $x_\text{mode}$ of the probabilty function is given by
$x_\text{mode} = \frac{\beta}{\alpha+1}$. The shape parameter
$\alpha$ needs to be positive and non-zero as well as the scale
parameter $\beta$ ($\alpha>0$, $\beta>0$).
The {\tt SASfit } version represents a reparametrization of the standard statistical
form. The parameter $\mu$ has been added to enable variable $x$ positioning.
Adjustment terms have been added so that $\mu$ is the mode $x_\text{mode}$.
The function returns $c_0$ for those $x$ where it is undefined.
Note that the amplitude form is much faster.

It is similar to the Beta distribution, but much simpler to use

function. The probability density function of the Kumaraswamy distribution is

p(x; \alpha,\beta) &= \alpha \beta x^{\alpha-1}{ (1-x^\alpha)}^{\beta-1}.

hyperbolic secant function $\operatorname{sech}$, it is sometimes referred to as
the sech-squared distribution. The mode, mean and median values are $x_0$.

\section{LogLogistic} ~\\
\label{sec:LogLogistic}
As may be indicated by the name, the loglogistic (known as the Fisk distribution in economics)
distribution has certain similarities to the logistic distribution. A random variable
is loglogistically distributed if the logarithm of the random variable is logistically distributed.
The \texttt{LogLogistic} distribution is a two-parameter distribution with parameters
$\sigma$ and $x_0$. It is similar in shape to the log-normal distribution but has heavier tails.

The pdf for this distribution is given by:
\begin{align}
p(x;\mu,\sigma) &=\frac{\exp\left(-\frac{\log\left(x\right)-\log(\mu)}{\sigma}\right)}{\sigma \left(x\right)\left(1+\exp\left(-\frac{\log(x)-\log(\mu)}{\sigma}\right)\right)^2}
= \frac{ \left(\frac{x}{\mu}\right)^{-1/\sigma} } { x\sigma\left[ 1+\left(\frac{x}{\mu}\right)^{-1/\sigma} \right]^2 }.
\end{align}
where $0 < x < \infty$, $-\infty < x_0 < \infty$ and $0 < \sigma < \infty$.
The mode of the \texttt{LogLogistic} distribution, if $\sigma < 1$, is given by:
\begin{align}
\mathrm{mode} &= \mu\left(\frac{1-\sigma}{1+\sigma}\right)^{\sigma}
\end{align}

\section{LogNormal}
\label{sec:LogNormal}
The LogNormal distribution is defined with reference to the normal
distribution. A random variable is Lognormally distributed if the
logarithm of the random variable is normally distributed.

The LogNormal distribution is commonly used for general reliability
analysis, cycles-to-failure in fatigue, material strengths and
loading variables in probabilistic design. Another advantage of the
LogNormal distribution is that it is positive-definite, so it is
often useful for representing quantities that cannot have negative
values. LogNormal distributions have proven useful as distributions
for rainfall amounts, for the size distributions of aerosol
particles or droplets, and for many other cases. The log-normal
distribution has the probability density function
\begin{equation}
f(x') = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}} \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{x'-\mu'}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)
\end{equation}
where $\mu'= \ln(\mu)$ and  $x'= \ln(x)$.
The lognormal pdf can be obtained, realizing that for equal probabilities
under the normal and lognormal pdfs, incremental areas should also be equal, or:
\begin{equation}%\label{}
    f(x;\mu,\sigma)dx =f(x';\mu,\sigma)dx'
\end{equation}
Taking the derivative yields:
\begin{equation}%\label{}
    dx' =\frac{dx}{x}
\end{equation}
Substitution yields:
\begin{equation}%\label{}
    f(x;\mu,\sigma) =\frac{f(x';\mu,\sigma)}{x}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{equation}
    f(x;\mu,\sigma) =
        \frac{1}{x\sigma \sqrt{2 \pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\ln (x) -
        \ln(\mu)}{\sigma}\right)^2\right)
\end{equation}
for $x\in (0,\infty]$, where  $\mu>0$ and $\sigma\neq 0$ are the location and scale
parameter. The mode of the distribution is
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{mode} =   \mu\exp\left(-\sigma^2\right)

\section{Lorentzian or Cauchy distribution}
\label{sec:Lorentzian}

The CauchyLorentz Distribution, named after
Augustin Cauchy and Hendrik Lorentz, is a continuous probability
distribution. As a probability distribution, it is known as the
Cauchy distribution, while among physicists, it is known as a
Lorentz distribution, or a Lorentz(ian) function or the BreitWigner
distribution. Its importance in physics is due to it being the solution to the
differential equation describing forced resonance. The Lorntzian
distribution has the probability density function
\begin{align}
 f(x; x_0,\sigma)&= \frac{1}{\pi\sigma \left[1 + \left(\frac{x-x_0}{\sigma}\right)^2\right]}  \\
                 &= { 1 \over \pi } \left[ { \sigma \over (x - x_0)^2 + \sigma^2 } \right]
\end{align}
where $x_0$ is the location parameter, specifying the location of the
peak of the distribution, and $\sigma$ is the scale parameter which
specifies the half-width at half-maximum (HWHM).

\section{Pearson-VII} ~\\
\label{sec:PearsonVII}
The \texttt{Pearson-VII} model has been used as
an approximation for the \texttt{Voigt} function.
The parameter $\sigma$ is the FWHM (full-width at half-maxima). When
$m$ is 1.0, the function is an exact Lorentzian. As the $m$-power term
increases, the function tends toward the Gaussian. For $m\sim 50$, the
function is essentially Gaussian. The \texttt{Pearson VII} function is a different
parametrization of the Student-t distribution function and reads as
\begin{align}
    p(x) &= \frac{1}{\alpha\,\mathrm{B}\!\left(m-\frac12, \frac12\right)}
        \left[1 + \left(\frac{x-\lambda}{\alpha}\right)^{\!2\,} \right]^{-m}
\end{align}
with $\alpha=\frac12\sigma/\sqrt{2^{1/m}-1}$ we get
\begin{align}
    p(x) &= \frac{2\sqrt{2^{1/m}-1}}{\sigma\,\mathrm{B}\!\left(m-\frac12, \frac12\right)}
             \left [ 1+ 4\left (\frac{x-x_0}{\sigma} \right )^2\left(2^{1/m}-1\right) \right ]^{-m}
\end{align}
where B is the Beta function.

\section{Voigt} ~\\
\label{sec:Voigt}
The Voigt profile is a spectral line profile found in all branches
of spectroscopy in which a spectral line is broadened by two types
of mechanisms, one of which alone would produce a Gaussian profile
(usually, as a result of the Doppler broadening), and the other
would produce a Lorentzian profile. The Voigt profile is then a
convolution of a Lorentz profile and a Gaussian profile:
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
V(x,x_c\vert\sigma,\gamma)& = \int_\infty^\infty D(x'\vert\sigma) \,
                                            L(x-x_c-x'\vert\gamma)\, dx'
\end{align}
where $x-x_c$ is distance from line center $x_c$, $D(x\vert\sigma)$ is the
centered Doppler profile:
\begin{align}
D(x\vert\sigma) & = \frac{e^{-x^2/2\sigma^2}}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}
\end{align}
and $L(x-x_c\vert\gamma)$ is the centered Lorentzian profile:
\begin{align}
L(x-x_c\vert\gamma) & = \frac{\gamma}{\pi((x-x_c)^2+\gamma^2)} .
\end{align}
The defining integral can be evaluated as \cite{David1986,Ida2000}:
\begin{align}
V(x,x_c) & = \frac{\Re[w(z)]}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}
\end{align}
where $\Re[w(z)]$ is the real part of the complex error function
of $z$ and
\begin{align}
z = \frac{x-x_c+i\gamma}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
The full width at half maximum (FWHM) of the Voigt profile can be found from
the widths of the associated Gaussian and Lorentzian widths. The FWHM of the
Gaussian profile is $f_G=2\sigma\sqrt{2\ln(2)}$.
The FWHM of the Lorentzian profile is just $f_L = 2\gamma$.
Define $\phi = f_\mathrm{L} / f_\mathrm{G}$. Then the FWHM of the Voigt profile ($f_\mathrm{V}$) can be estimated as:
\begin{equation}
    f_\mathrm{V}\approx f_\mathrm{G}\left(1-c_0c_1+\sqrt{\phi^2+2c_1\phi+c_0^2c_1^2}\right)
\end{equation}
where $c_0 = 2.0056$ and $c_1 = 1.0593$. This estimate will have a standard deviation of
error of about 2.4 percent for values of $\phi$ between 0 and 10. Note that the above
equation will have the proper behavior in the limit of $\phi=0$ and $\phi=\infty$.
A different approximation was given by \cite{Olivero1977,Liu2001}
\begin{equation}
    f_\mathrm{V}\approx 0.5346 f_\mathrm{L}+\sqrt{0.2166f_\mathrm{L}^2+f_\mathrm{G}^2}
\end{equation}
with an accuracy of 0.02%

\subsection{Weibull} ~\\
\label{sec:Weibull}

The Weibull distribution is a continuous probability distribution.
It is named after Waloddi Weibull who described it in detail in
1951, although it was first identified by Fr\'{e}chet (1927) and first
applied by Rosin \& Rammler (1933) to describe the size distribution
of particles. The probability density function of a Weibull random
variable $x$ is:
\begin{align}
p(x;\lambda,k) &=
    \begin{cases}
         \frac{k}{\lambda}\left(\frac{x}{\lambda}\right)^{k-1}e^{-(x/\lambda)^{k}} & x\geq0\\
         0 & x<0
    \end{cases}
\end{align}
where $k > 0$ is the shape parameter and $\lambda > 0$ is the scale parameter of the distribution.
For $k>1$ the $\mathrm{mode}$ is given by
\begin{align}
\mathrm{mode} &= \lambda \left(\frac{k-1}{k} \right)^{\frac{1}{k}}\, \mbox{if } k > 1.
\end{align}
\subsection{Weibull (Amplitude)} ~\\
\label{sec:WeibullAmplitude}
The amplitude version represents a reparametrization of the standard statistical
form. The parameter $x_0$ has been added to enable variable $x$ positioning. An
additional adjustment term has been added so that $x_0$ represents the mode.
The function returns $c_0$ for those $x$ where it is undefined.
\begin{align}
u & = \frac{k-1}{k}  \\
z & = \frac{x-x_0}{\lambda}+u^{1/k}   \\
y(x;x_0,k,\lambda,c_0,A) &=
    \begin{cases}
        c_0 + A u^{-u} z^{k-1} \exp\left(-z^k\right) & z >= 0 \\

This model considers a dense core and original two shells
\cite{Willner2000}. Besides, it considers two different density
profiles: a parabolic and a star-like profile for the second shell.
\begin{align}
\eta_\text{shell}(r) & \propto r^{-x} \quad \text{for starlike profile $x=4/3$}\\
\eta_\text{shell}(r) & \propto 1-\left(\frac{r}{L_p}\right)^{2}
\quad \text{for parabolic profile of thickness $L_p$}
\end{align}
Model parameters:

\item[$x_\text{star}$] relative distribution of
parbolic:starlike profile in 2$^\text{nd}$ shell, one has to put a
very high value in order to consider only a star-like profile.
\item[$\gamma$] for star-like profile the exponent is $4/3$ and for a constant profile chose 0
\item[$L_p$] thickness of parabolic brush (must fit in 2$^\text{nd}$ shell!)
\end{description}
\begin{align}
I(Q) = %\frac{amplitu}{V_c+V_b}
\left[\Delta b_c F_c + \Delta b_b (F_1+F_2)\right]^2
\end{align}
\begin{align}
\Delta b_c &= b_\text{core} - b_\text{solv}  (1-f_\text{core}) \\
\Delta b_b &= b_\text{brush} - b_\text{solv} (1-f_\text{brush})
\end{align}
$V_c$ and $V_b$ are the core and shell bulk volumes respectively.
\\

\noindent \textbf{Mass Conservation:} \\
From the given values of the molecular weights of the two blocks and
their densities, and an assumed aggregation number $N_\text{agg}$,
the bulk volumes of the core and the shell, $V_c$ and $V_b$, can be
calculated.

\noindent \textbf{Core:}
\begin{align}
& \text{bulk core volume:} \quad          V_c = \frac{N_\text{agg} M_\text{core}}{\rho_\text{core}N_a} \\

\begin{align}
& \text{bulk shell volume:} \quad         V_b = \frac{N_\text{agg}
M_\text{shell}}{\rho_\text{shell}N_a}
\end{align}
The relative amount of shell material in the first shell
$f_\text{shell1}$ is controlled by the parameter $p_{12}$, so that
the portion of the second shell $f_\text{shell2}$ can be obtained
through:
\begin{align}
f_\text{shell1} &= \frac{p_{12}}{1+p_{12}} \\
f_\text{shell2} &= 1-f_\text{shell1}

& \text{effective core radius:} \quad     R_1 = R_{c1} + d_1^+ \\
& \text{swollen volume of first shell:} \quad       V_{s1s} = \frac{4}{3}\pi R_1^3 \\
& \text{swelling factor:} \quad           s_{s1} =
\frac{V_{s1s}-V_{sc}}{V_{s1}}
\end{align}

\noindent \textbf{Shell 2:}
\begin{align}
& \text{portion of the total shell volume in second shell:} \quad  V_{s2} = f_\text{shell2} V_b \\
& \text{minimal radius of shell:}        \quad R_{c2} = \left(\frac{3}{4\pi} (V_{s1s}+V_{s2})\right)^{1/3} \\
& \text{effective core radius:}          \quad R_2 = R_{c2} + d_2^+ \\
& \text{swollen volume of second shell:} \quad V_{s2s} = \frac{4}{3}\pi R_2^3 \\
& \text{swelling factor:}                \quad s_{s2} = \frac{V_{s2s}-V_{s1s}}{V_{s2}}\\
& \text{fraction of star-like density profile in 2$^\text{nd}$
shell:} \quad  f_\text{star} =2
\frac{\arctan({\left\vert \right\vert}{p_\text{star}})}{\pi}
\end{align}

\noindent Together with the profile functions $\Phi_c(r,R_c)$,
$\Phi_1(r,R_1,R_2)$, $\Phi_2(r,R_1,R_2,f_\text{star})$ and
\begin{align}
f_\text{Fermi}(x) = \frac{1}{1+\exp(x)}

factor are determined by numerical integration. \sloppy

\section{LogNorm\_fp} \hspace{1pt}
\label{sec:sd_lognorm_fp}

The \texttt{LogNorm} distribution is a continuous distribuion in which the logarithm of a variable
has a normal distribution.
\begin{subequations}
\begin{align}
\text{LogNorm}(x,\mu,\sigma,p) &=  \frac{N}{c_\text{LN}}
                                    \frac{1}{x^{p}}\,
                                    \exp\!\!\left(-\frac{\ln(x/\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}\right) \\
c_\text{LN} &= \sqrt{2\pi}\,\sigma \,\mu^{1-p}
\,\exp\!\!\left((1-p)^2\frac{\sigma^2}{2}\right)
\label{eq:LogNorm}
\end{align}
\end{subequations}
where $\sigma$ is the width parameter, $p$ a shape parameter, $\mu$ is the location parameter.
$c_\text{LN}$ is choosen so that $\int_0^\infty\! \text{LogNorm}(x,\mu,\sigma,p)\,dR = N$
The mode of the distribution is defined as
\begin{align}
x_\text{mode} = \mu e^{-p \sigma^2}
\end{align}
and the $n^\text{th}$ moment $\langle X^n\rangle$ of the \texttt{LogNorm} distribution as
\begin{align}
\langle X^n\rangle = \frac{\int X^n\, \textrm{LogNorm}(X)\, dX}{\int \textrm{LogNorm}(X)\, dX} =
\mu^n \, e^{\frac{1}{2} \sigma^2 n (2 - 2 p + n)}.
\label{eq:nMoment:LogNorm}
\end{align}

Instead of using the parameter $N$ (particle number density) another
Log-Normal size distribution namely {\tt LogNorm\_fp} with the
volume fraction $f_p$ as a parameter has been implemented.
Using the volume fraction as a scaling parameter requires that the intensity is
given in units of cm$^{-1}$ and the scattering vector in nm$^{-1}$. Furthermore
the scattering contrast needs to be supplied in units of cm$^{-2}$. More details
about absolute intensity can be found in chapter \ref{ch:absint}.
The volume fraction $f_p$ can be obtained by the \texttt{LogNorm}-distribution
(eq.\ \ref{eq:LogNorm}) by integrating over the particle volume $V_P$. In case
of spheres we get
\begin{align}
f_p &= 10^{21} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{LogNorm}(R) V_P(R) \, dR \label{eq:fpMomentsV} \\
    &= 10^{21} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{LogNorm}(R) \frac{4}{3}\pi R^3 \, dR = 10^{21}
    N \frac{4}{3}\pi \langle X^3 \rangle .
\end{align}
The scaling factor $10^{21}$ depends on the actual units. More details are
given in section \ref{sec:volumefraction}.


For other shapes than spheres the corresponding volume of the object has to be used in eq.\ \ref{eq:fpMomentsV}.
In case of cylinders the volume is given by $V_\text{cyl}=\pi R^2 L$. Depending whether the radius $R$ or the
cylinder length $L$ has a size distribution the volume fraction $fp$ is calculated differently namely
in case for a radius distribution by
\begin{align}
f_p &= 10^{21} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{LogNorm}(R) V_\text{cyl}(R,L) \, dR \label{eq:fpMomentsV} \\
    &= 10^{21} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{LogNorm}(R) \pi R^2L \, dR = 10^{21} N \pi L \langle X^2 \rangle
\end{align}
and in case of a length distribution by
\begin{align}
f_p % &= 10^{21} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{LogNorm}(L) V_\text{cyl}(R,L) \, dL  \\
    &= 10^{21} \int_0^\infty \mathrm{LogNorm}(L) \pi R^2L \, dL = 10^{21} N \pi R^2 \langle X \rangle .
\end{align}
As the cylinder volume depends on $R^2$  and $L$ either the second or the first moment of the distribution
function is involved in calculating the volume fraction depending which parameter has a distribution.
For a spherical shell a sum of different moments has to be used as listed in table \ref{tab:volumefraction}.

\chapter{Basic Analysis of Dynamic Light Scattering Data}
\label{basicDLS}
In a typical dynamic light scattering (DLS) or photo correlation scattering (PCS)
experiment, the autocorrelation function $G^{(2)}(\tau)$ of the intensity scattered
by dispersed particles is determined as a function of the delay $\tau$. $G^{(2)}(\tau)$
is related to the modulus of the normalized field autocorrelation function $g_1(\tau)$
by a Siegert relationship
\begin{align}
G^{(2)}(\tau) & = A g^2_1(\tau)  + B.
\end{align}
Here $B$ is a background term often designated as the baseline and $A$ can be considered
as another instrumental factor. The time dependence of $g_1(\tau)$ is related to the
dynamics of the dispersed particles. For particles in Brownian motion, the time decay of
$g_1(\tau)$ is determined by the diffusion coefficient of the dispersed particles. In particular,
for monodisperse samples $g_1(\tau)$ is an exponentially decaying function:
\begin{align}
g_1(\tau) & = \exp(-\Gamma\tau) \label{g1}\\
\text{ or } &  \\
G^{(2)}(\tau)  & = A \exp(-2\Gamma\tau) + B
\label{G2}
\end{align}
where the decay rate $\Gamma$ is linked to the particles' diffusion coefficient $D$
by $\Gamma=D Q^2$, where $Q$ is the modulus of the scattering vector
\begin{align}
Q = \frac{4\pi m_1}{\lambda_0} \sin(\theta/2)
\end{align}
$m_1$ is the refraction index of the solution, $\lambda_0$ the wavelength in vacuo
of the incident light and $\theta$ the scattering angle. At the end the Stokes-Einstein
expression for the diffusion coefficient is used to get an average particle radius
$R_\text{DLS}$
\begin{align}
D = \frac{kT}{6\pi\eta R_\text{DLS}}
\label{DiffRDLS}
\end{align}
where $k$ is Boltzmann's constant, $T$ the absolute temperature, $\eta$ the viscosity
of the dispersion medium and $R_\text{DLS}$ the particle radius (only valid for noninteracting
particles).

\newpage
\section{Cumulant Analysis}
The formulas in eq.\ \ref{g1} to \ref{DiffRDLS} are valid for monodisperse
dispersions only. For polydisperse dispersions the cumulants method of Koppel (1972) is widely used,
which assumes a multi-exponential behaviour so that $g_1(\tau)$ and $G^{(2)}(\tau)$
can be written in a series expansion as:
\begin{align}
 g_1(\tau)  &= \exp\left(-\Gamma_1 \tau + \frac{\Gamma_2 \tau^2}{2} - \frac{\Gamma_3 \tau^3}{6} + \cdots \right)\\
 G^{(2)}(\tau) &=  A \exp\left(- 2\Gamma_1 \tau + \Gamma_2 \tau^2 - \frac{\Gamma_3 \tau^3}{3} + \cdots \right) + B
\label{G2Cumulant}
\end{align}
\texttt{SASfit} assumes for the cumulant fit-routine that the function $G^{(2)}(\tau)$ is supplied. As normally no error
bar is available from the correlator a robust least square procedure is implemented.

\subsection{The least squares minimiser and the robust least squares
procedure}
The function to be minimised is
$$
\chi^2 = \sum_i \left( \frac{r_i}{\Delta I_i} \right)^2
$$
where the residual is defined as
$$
r_i = I_i - I_{i,th}.
$$
Here $I_i$  is the intensity correlation function $G^{(2)}(t_i)$
at time $t_i$ with already subtracted baseline as received from a correlator, $I_{i,th}$ is the value
of the cumulant fit according to eq.\ \ref{G2Cumulant} or a double exponential decay according to
eq.\ \ref{G2DoubleExpDecay}. Normally no error values
$\Delta I_i$ are supplied from the correlator so that all data points are weighted
the same. A robust fitting with bisquare weights is implemented which uses an
iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm, and follows the procedure:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Fit the model by an unweighted least
squares (that is,  $\chi$).
\item Standardize the residuals via $u_i=r_i/(Ks)$. Here $K$
is a tuning constant equal to 4.685, and $s$ is the robust variance
given by $MAD/0.6745$, where $MAD$ is the median absolute deviation of
the residuals
$$
MAD = \sum_{i=1}^N \frac{1}{N}{\left\vert \right\vert}{I_{i,th}-I_i}
$$
\item Compute the robust weights $w_i$ as a function of the standardized residuals $u_i$.
The bisquare weights are given by
$$
w_i =
\begin{cases}
\left(1-u_i^2 \right)^2 & {\left\vert u_i\right\vert} < 1 \\
0                       & {\left\vert u_i\right\vert} \geq 1
\end{cases}
$$
\item  Re-do the fit using the weighted minimiser:
$$
\chi^2 = \sum_i w_i \left( \frac{r_i}{\Delta I_i} \right)^2
$$
\item The fit converges when the MAD changes by no more than the fraction set by
{\verb"residual_tolerance"} (which has been chosen to be $10^{-8}$). Otherwise, perform the next iteration of the
fitting procedure by returning to the first step.

\section{Scattering Cross-Section}
\label{crosssection}

In a scattering experiment one is interested in a detailed
analysis of the scattering pattern as a function of the
characteristics of the incident beam. Monochromator and collimator
specify direction and energy of the incident radiation.  The
radiation interacts with the sample and receives thereby a
momentum transfer $\hbar {\underline{ Q}}$. By this process the radiation
receives beside a direction change also an energy change. The
result is described with the help of a cross-section.

\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth,height=0.45\textwidth]{EwaldSphereTeX.png}
\end{center}
\caption{Schematic representation of a scattering process}
\label{scatt2}
\end{figure}

A detector with an efficiency $\epsilon$ measures for this the
number of the scattered neutrons or photons in a given direction
${\bf k}_0+\bf Q$.  The distance between detector and sample
should be large in comparison to the linear dimension of the
detector, so that the solid angle included by the detector element
$\Delta\Omega$ is small.

If the incident beam has a homogeneous, continuous flow
density $\Phi_0$ ($[\Phi_0 ] = $ neutron (photons -) per cm$^2$
and second) and if the beam contain $N$ identical particles, then
the counting rate $C$ of the detector is proportional to all these
quantities. The proportionality constant is called differential
scattering cross-section $ \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega } =
\frac{C}{\Phi_0 \, \epsilon \, N \, \Delta\Omega } $.  In the case
of inelastic scattering the counting rate is in a certain interval
$\delta E$ of transferred energy in addition proportionally to
$\delta E$. The appropriate proportionality constant is the
partial (or double) differential scattering cross-section
$$
\frac{d^2\sigma}{d\Omega\, dE} = \frac{C}{\Phi_0\, \epsilon\, N\,
\Delta\Omega \,\Delta E } = \rm
\frac{\mbox{\parbox[b]{9.4cm}{\footnotesize Number of neutrons
(photons), which are scattered per second into the solid angle
$d\Omega$ toward $\phi, \theta$ with an energy between $E$ and
$E+dE$}} }{N \Phi_0\, d\Omega\, dE}
$$
The total differential cross-section is defined as
\begin{equation}
\sigma_t = (\mbox{total number of scattered neutrons (photons) per sec})/\Phi_0 .
\end{equation}
The three different cross-section are related to each other by
\begin{equation}
\sigma_t = \int d\Omega\, \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} \qquad \mbox{and}
\qquad \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \int_0^{\infty}dE\,
                                  \frac{d^2\sigma}{d\Omega\, dE}
.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Scattering of neutrons on atoms}
The scattering of neutrons can be explained by two types of interactions between
neutrons and matter; once the strong spin dependent nuclear forces between nuclei
and neutron (interaction range $\sim 10^{-15}$m) and secondly the dipole-dipole
interaction  between the magnetic moment of the neutron and that of an unpaired electron,
or nuclei accordingly. Both interactions have in common that their interaction potential
$V({\underline{ r}})$ for $r \rightarrow \infty$ decays faster than $1/r$. For this kind of interaction
potential the quantum mechanical scattering theory \cite{hittmair} yields as an asymptotic
approximation for the Schr\"odinger equation of the wave function
\begin{equation} \displaystyle
\psi_{{\underline{ k}}_0}({\underline{ r}})
\xrightarrow[r\rightarrow\infty]{} \displaystyle
\frac{1}{(2\pi)^{3/2}} \left[e^{\imath{\underline{ k}}_0{\underline{ r}}} +
f(\theta,\phi)\frac{e^{\imath k_0 r}}{r}\right]
\quad .
\end{equation}
For low energy particles and short range potential the partial waves methods yields for the
scattering amplitude $f(\theta,\phi) = -b$, whereby the so called scattering length $b$ can
be determined experimentally. Via another Ansatz, the Born approximation, one gets a series
expansion for $f(\theta,\phi)$. The first term of this series expansion is give by
\begin{equation} \displaystyle
f^{(0)}(\theta,\phi)
= - \frac{m_N}{2 \pi \hbar^2} \int d{\underline{ r}}\, e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}} V({\underline{ r}})
\quad ,
\end{equation}
with ${\underline{ Q}} = {\underline{ k-k}}_0$. A comparison of this result with the partial wave method
($f(\theta,\phi)=-b$), shows that the pseudo potential
$V({\underline{ r}}) = \frac{2\pi\hbar^2}{m_N} \, b \, \delta({\underline{ r}})$
(Fermi's pseudo potential) has an equivalent solution. For an ensemble of $N$ atoms,
e.g. a crystal, the total potential is in kinematic approximation the sum of the
individual potentials
\begin{equation} \displaystyle
V({\underline{ r}}) = \frac{2 \pi \hbar^2}{m_N} \sum_{j=1}^{N} b_j \delta({\underline{ r-r}}_j)
\quad , \label{fermipot}
\end{equation}
whereby ${\underline{ r}}_j$ describes the position of nuclei $j$ with scattering the length $b_j$ and $N$
the number of scattering atoms. The scattering length $b_j$ depends on the element or
isotope which is the scattering center. Furthermore it can depend on the spin state of the
neutron and the nuclei and on unpaired electrons in non fully occupied atomic electron shells.
In the kinematic approximation it is assumed that the intensity of the incoming beam is identical
at each scattering center, i.e. that the scattered intensity does not attenuate the incoming beam.
Furthermore it is assumed that the incoming beam is only scattered once and multiple scattered
can be neglected.

In the static approximation, i.e. for a scattering process which does not change the state of the
scattering center and therefore is an elastic scattering process, the differential scattering
cross-section can be described in terms of a scattering amplitude
$f^{(0)}(\theta,\phi)$ by
\begin{equation} \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}}) = \frac{1}{N}\,
{\left\vert \right\vert}{f^{(0)}(\theta,\phi)}^2 = \frac{1}{N}\, \left(
\frac{m_N}{2\pi\hbar^2}\right)^2 \, {\left\vert \right\vert}{\int d{\underline{ r}}\,
e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}}\, V({\underline{ r}})}^2 \quad . \label{scatteringfunction}
\end{equation}
Using Fermi's pseudo potentials (eq. \ref{fermipot}) leads to the expression
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}})  = \frac{1}{N} \,
{\left\vert \right\vert}{\sum_{j=1}^N\, b_j\, e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}_j}}^2  =
 \frac{1}{N}\,\sum_{i,j} b_i\, b_j\, e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}_i}\, e^{-\imath{\underline{ Qr}}_j}
\label{scatteq1}
\end{equation}

Let us now consider a new system of scatterers, which are only different to those from
eq. \ref{scatteq1} that the scattering length of the nuclei are exchanged. Hereby both
the position and fraction of the scattering length $b_i$ are kept the same.
For a large number of scattering centers the average over the cross-sections of all possible
systems of scatterers which are identical to the one in \ref{scatteq1}
can be described by
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}}) = \frac{1}{N}\,
                          \sum_{i,j} \overline{b_i\, b_j}\,
                          e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}_i} \, e^{-\imath{\underline{ Qr}}_j}
\qquad . \label{scatteq2}
\end{equation}
If the scattering length $b_i$ occur in the same fraction $x_i$,
whereby $\sum_i x_i = 1$, so that the averages
$\overline{b}$ and $\overline{b^2}$ can be written as
\begin{equation}
\overline{b} = \sum_i x_i\, b_i \mbox{~~~ and ~~~}  \overline{b^2} = \sum_i
x_i b_i^2 \quad .
\end{equation}
Under the condition that there are no correlations between the scattering lengths of
the individual nuclei one can write
\begin{equation}
\overline{b_i\, b_j} = \overline{b}^2 \mbox{~for~} i \neq j
\qquad \mbox{~and~} \qquad
\overline{b_i\, b_j} = \overline{b^2} \mbox{~for~} i = j
\end{equation}
From this it follows for the differential cross-section
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}}) = \frac{1}{N} \left( \overline{b^2} +
\overline{b}^2 \sum_{i,j \atop i\neq j} e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}_i} \,
                                        e^{-\imath{\underline{ Qr}}_j} \right)
=
\underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\left( \overline{b^2}-\overline{b}^2\right)
             }_{\frac{d\sigma_{\rm inc}}{d\Omega}} +
  \underbrace{\frac{1}{N}\, \overline{b}^2 \, {\left\vert \right\vert}{\sum_i e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}_i}}^2
             }_{\frac{d\sigma_{\rm coh}}{d\Omega}}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Nuclear scattering}
The simplest system of scatterers consist of only one isotope with nuclear spin $I$.
As the spin of the neutron is $s = \pm 1/2$ only two orientations are possible: parallel
spins of neutron and nuclei, i.e. a total spin of $J_{(+)}=I+1/2$ or antiparallel spins,
i.e $J_{(-)}=I-1/2$.  The corresponding scattering length are named $b_{(+)}$ and
$b_{(-)}$.\footnote{For coherent scattering the spin of the neutrons keep constant in
contrast to incoherent scattering where a part come along with a spin-flip. This can e.g.
be used to change the ration between coherent and incoherent scattering.}

The number of possible states for the total spin $J_{(\pm)}$ are
$2J_{(+)}+1 = 2I+2$ and $2J_{(-)}+1 = 2I$. In case of unpolarized neutrons and/or
random oriented nuclear spins parallel and antiparallel spin states have the same
probability. The fraction $x_{(\pm)}$ of the scattering lengths $b_{(\pm)}$
is therefore proportional to the corresponding number of states
\begin{equation}
x_{(+)} = \frac{2J_{(+)}+1}{\left(2J_{(+)}+1\right) + \left(2J_{(-)}+1\right)}
= \frac{I+1}{2I+1} \mbox{~and~} x_{(-)} = \frac{I}{2I+1} \quad .
\end{equation}
For the average scattering length $\overline{b}$ we therefore get
\begin{equation}
\overline{b} = \sum_{i=(+),(-)} x_i\, b_i =\frac{1}{2I+1}\left[ (I+1)\, b_{(+)}
+ I\, b_{(-)} \right] \quad .
\end{equation}
For a mixture of different elements and isotopes of type $l$ with nuclear spin $I_l$
and the fraction  $x_l$ (with $\sum_l x_l = 1$) the averages can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
\overline{b} &=& \sum_l \frac{x_l}{2I_l+1} \left[ (I_l+1)\, b_{l(+)}
+ I_l\, b_{l(-)} \right]  \\
\overline{b^2} &=& \sum_l \frac{x_l}{2I_l+1} \left[ (I_l+1)\,
\left(b_{l(+)}\right)^2
+ I_l\, \left(b_{l(-)}\right)^2 \right] \quad .
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Magnetic Scattering}
In magnetic materials the contribution of the interaction between neutrons
and atomic magnetic dipole moments to the scattering length has the same order
of magnitude than the nuclear scattering length. The magnetic scattering is based
on the interaction of the magnetic moment of the neutron $\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_n$ with the magnetic
moment of the scattering atom $\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_A$. The magnetic interaction potential $V({\underline{ r}})$
is described by
\begin{equation}
 V({\underline{ r}}) = -\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_n \cdot {\underline{ B}}({\underline{ r}}),
\end{equation}
whereby $\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_n=\gamma\frac{e \hbar}{2 m_p}\mbox{\boldmath$ \sigma$}=\gamma\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_N$ is the magnetic dipole
moment\footnote{neutron magnetic moment: $\mu_n=-0.966 236 45 \times 10^{-26}$ JT$^{-1}$,
 neutron magnetic moment to Bohr magneton ratio:$\mu_{\rm n}/\mu_{\rm B}=-1.041 875 63 \times 10^{-3}$,

elementary charge: $e=1.602 176 53 \times 10^{-19}$ C,

the neutron, \mbox{\boldmath$ \sigma$} Pauli's spin operator, $\gamma$ the
neutron magnetic moment to nuclear magneton
ratio\footnote{neutron magnetic moment to nuclear magneton ratio $\gamma = \mu_{\rm n}/\mu_{\rm N}-1.913 042 73$}
and ${\underline{ B}}({\underline{ r}})$ the magnetic field of an atom at the position of the neutron.
An atom generates a magnetic field due to the magnetic dipole moment $\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_S$ of its
electrons ${\underline{ B}}_S({\underline{ r}})$
\begin{equation}
{\underline{ B}}_S({\underline{ r}}) = \mbox{\boldmath$ \nabla$} \times {\underline{ A}} \,\mbox{ ~with~} {\underline{ A}} =
\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\, \frac{\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_S \times{\underline{ r}}}{r^3}
\end{equation}
and due to the orbital angular momentum of the electrons ${\underline{ l}} = -{\underline{ p}}\times{\underline{ r}}$
which generates a field of ${\underline{ B}}_L({\underline{ r}})$
\begin{equation}
{\underline{ B}}_L({\underline{ r}}) = -\frac{\mu_0}{4\pi}\, \frac{2\mu_B}{\hbar}\,
\frac{{\underline{ p}}\times{\underline{ r}}}{r^3}.
\end{equation}
The magnetic interaction potential
$V({\underline{ r}}) = -\mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_n\cdot({\underline{ B}}_S({\underline{ r}})+{\underline{ B}}_L({\underline{ r}}))$
is a weak long range potential which also can be treated with
Born's approximation.
Compared to the nuclear scattering amplitude the corresponding magnetic scattering
amplitude $b_M$ is given by the Fourier transformation of the magnetic interaction potential
$\mathcal{F}[V({\underline{ r}})]$
\begin{equation}
b_M = -\frac{m_n}{2\pi\hbar^2}\, \mbox{\boldmath$ \mu$}_n \cdot \int d^3r \,
e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}}\, ({\underline{ B}}_S({\underline{ r}})+{\underline{ B}}_L({\underline{ r}})).
\end{equation}
The Fourier transformation of the magnetic field is related in case of a static magnetic field
to the Fourier transformation of the local magnetization
 ${\underline{ M}}({\underline{ Q}}) = \mathcal{F}[{\underline{ M}}({\underline{ r}})]$ \cite{book:Squires} by
\begin{equation}
{\underline{ B}}({\underline{ Q}}) = \mu_0\, \frac{{\underline{ Q}}\times [{\underline{ M}}({\underline{ Q}})\times{\underline{ Q}}]}{Q^2}
             = \mu_0\, {\underline{ M}}_{\bot}({\underline{ Q}}),
\end{equation}
whereby ${\underline{ M}}_{\bot}({\underline{ Q}})$ is the component of ${\underline{ M}}({\underline{ Q}})$ perpendicular to ${\underline{ Q}}$ and
$\mu_0 = 4\pi\, 10^{-7}$ Vs/Am the magnetic constant. For the magnetic scattering
amplitude\footnote{Frequently the magnetization is given in units of Bohr magnetons
($\mu_B=\frac{e\hbar}{2m_e}=927.400 949 \times 10^{-26}$ J/T, 1[J/T]=1[Am$^2$])
per atomic volume $\Omega$ so that the magnetic scattering length density can be written as $b_M=D_{\mu}\sum_i c_i{M_i}/\Omega_i$ with
$D_\mu=2.69914\times 10^{-15}$m$^2$. The two constants are related via $D_\mu=D_M\mu_0\mu_B$.} $b_M$
we find than
\begin{equation}
b_M = D_M\, \mu_0\, \mbox{\boldmath$\sigma$}\cdot {\underline{ M}}_{\bot}({\underline{ Q}})
\mbox{~ with ~} D_M = -\gamma\, \frac{m_n}{2\pi\hbar^2}\, \mu_N = 2.31605 \times
10^{14} \, \frac{1}{\mbox{m$^2$ Tesla}}. \quad
\end{equation}
For scattering on magnetic structures always two interactions have to be considered,
nuclear scattering which is caused by fluctuations in the number density and composition
and magnetic scattering caused by fluctuations in amplitude and/or orientation of the local
magnetization. In case of a preferred orientation, e.g. the direction of an external applied
magnetic field ${\underline{ H}}$, the magnetic scattering depends on the spin state {\boldmath $\sigma$}
of the neutron. If ${\underline{ e}}_x$ describes the direction of the preferred axis and ($+$) and ($-$)
the neutron spin polarisation antiparallel and parallel to ${\underline{ e}}_x$ than the scattering can
be described by four scattering processes; these are two spin non-flip ($++$,$--$) and two
spin flip ($+-$,$-+$) processes. Moon, Riste und Koehler \cite{scatt91} have shown that for
coherent scattering the four scattering length are given by
\begin{eqnarray}
b_{\pm\pm} &= b_N \mp D_M\, \mu_0\, M_{\bot x} \label{eq:Spin:pmpm}\\
b_{\pm\mp} &= - D_M\, \mu_0\, (M_{\bot z} \pm \imath \, M_{\bot
y}).
\end{eqnarray}
whereby $b_N$ is the nuclear scattering length. In case of unpolarized neutrons the
differential scattering cross-section can be written as
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma_{\rm unp}}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}}) =
         \frac{d\sigma_{\rm nuc}}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}})
       + \frac{d\sigma_{\rm mag}}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}}) ,
\end{equation}
because $(b_{++}^2+b_{--}^2+b_{+-}^2+b_{-+}^2)/2 = b_N^2+D_M^2
\mu_0^2 M_{\bot}^2$. For unpolarized neutrons the interference contribution only has
an influence on the degree of polarization of the scattered neutrons but not on the scattering
intensity.

\subsection{Scattering of x-ray at atoms}

The scattering of x-rays on matter practically exclusively depends on the interaction
of the incoming radiation with electrons. The contribution on the nuclei is negligible small
because the mass of the nuclei is more than $10^3$ times larger than the mass of an electron and
the energy of the nuclear scattering more than $10^6$ smaller than the energy of the scattering
on electrons.

The frequency $\nu_0 = c/\lambda$ of the incoming x-ray beam is in general large against
the resonance frequency of the electrons. In this case the electrons can be considered to be
free and the special properties of the chemical binding are of no importance. These are the conditions
for Thomson-scattering. J.J. Thomson developed a simple classical model for this type of scattering.
Under the influence of an electric field of x-rays electrons start to oscillate. For an incoming plane
and monochromatic wave with an electric field ${\underline{ E}} = {\underline{ E}}_0 e^{\imath ({\underline{ k}}_0{\underline{ r}} -
\omega t)}$ the amplitude $E_s$ of a wave scattered on a free electron is
\begin{equation}
E_s = -E_0 \frac{e^2}{m_e c^2} \frac{1}{r} \sin \psi .
\end{equation}
Hereby $e$ and $m_e$ are the
charge\footnote{$e = 1.602 176 53 \times 10^{-19}$ C} and
mass\footnote{$m_e = 9.109 3826 \times 10^{-31}$ kg} of the electron, respectively. $c$ is the speed of light\footnote{$c = 299 792 458$ m s$^{-1}$},
$r$ the distance between sample and detector and $\psi$ the angle between the direction of the accelerated
electrons by the incoming wave and the direction of the scattered wave.

Analogously to the neutron scattering length for an electron the x-ray scattering length
(far field of a Hertz dipole) is defined as
\begin{equation}
b_{\rm x-ray} = \frac{e^2}{m_e c^2} \sin\psi = r_0 \sin\psi
\end{equation}
whereby $r_0 = e^2 / (m_e c^2) = 2.82 \times 10^{-13}$ cm is the classical electron radius.
For small angle scattering $\psi \simeq \pi/2$ whereby the angle dependent polarization factor is
approximately 1.

For calculating the scattering amplitude of an atom with $Z$ electrons one has to sum up
the scattered waves from the different electrons with the correct phase.
To do this an electron density distribution $\rho_e({\underline{ r}})$ can be introduced which describes the time average
probability distribution of the electron in the atom. The scattering amplitude of an atom is than
\begin{equation}
 f_a({\underline{ Q}}) = r_0\, \underbrace{L(Q)}_{{\rm {polarization\atop {factor}}}\sim 1}
\int d{\underline{ r}} \, \rho_e({\underline{ r}})\, e^{\imath {\underline{ Qr}}}
\stackrel{Q\rightarrow 0}{=} r_0\, Z. \label{diffx}
\end{equation}
The charge distribution in an atom can be described in good approximation by a radial symmetric
function so that
 \begin{equation}
f_a(Q) = r_0 \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin Qr}{Qr} \, \rho_e(r) \,
4\pi r^2\, dr  \stackrel{Q\rightarrow 0}{=} r_0 \int_0^{\infty}
\rho_e(r) \, 4\pi r^2\, dr  = r_0 Z . \label{diffx}
\end{equation}
In small angle scattering the scattering length of an atom is therefore
$f_a = r_0 Z$ or in units of "electon units [e.u.]" $f=f_a/r_0=Z$.
~\\

\subsubsection{Anomalous scattering of x-rays}

The relation $f=Z$ for atomic scattering length is only valid as long as the energy of the incoming radiation
is much larger than the energy of the K-, L-, etc. shells. In case that the absorption edge of an atom is close
to the energy of the incoming beam the scattering length has to be corrected by a dispersion term.
In general the scattering length of an atom depends on the energy of the x-rays and is a complex number
\begin{equation}
f(E) = Z + f'(E) + \imath f''(E) \quad .
\end{equation}
The correction terms $f'$ and $f''$ change the scattering length $f$ near a
K$_{\alpha}$ absorption edge typically up to 30\%.
Figure \ref{fpfppsketch} shows the energy dependency of the scattering length of iron
$f'_{\rm Fe}$ und $f''_{\rm Fe}$.
The dispersion terms are related via the Karamer-Kronig relation
\begin{equation}
f'(E) = \frac{2}{\pi}\, \int_0^{\infty} dE'\,
        \frac{E'\, f''(E')}{E'^2-E^2}.
\label{KramerKronig}
\end{equation}
\begin{figure}[htb]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.7441\textwidth,height=0.7858\textwidth]{FEFPFPP.png}
\caption{Energy dependence of the real and imaginary part of the scattering length of iron:
$Z_{\rm Fe}+ f'_{\rm Fe}(E)$ and $f''_{\rm Fe}(E)$ ($Z_{\rm Fe}=26$)}
\label{fpfppsketch}
\end{center}
\end{figure}
In general the imaginary part $f''$ can be determined experimentally by the mass absorption
coefficient $\mu_m(E)=\frac{2N_A}{A}\, \lambda\, r_0\, f''(E)$ ($N_a$ Avogadro number, $A$
mass of atom in resonance) to calculate than with equation \ref{KramerKronig} the real part of the
scattering length $f'(E)$.

\section{Small angle scattering}

In small angle scattering geometry the structural unit down to single atoms can not be resolved,
only structures larger than several atomic layers can be seen by that method. Small angle
scattering techniques measure the beam scattered close to forward direction whereby the beam
divergence is in the order $\lambda/L \ll 1$. For a wavelength of  $\lambda = 1$ nm and
a characteristic dimension $L = V^{1/3}$ of the scatterer of about 10 nm the divergency of the beam
is  about $\lambda/L = 0.1 \mbox{ rad} \simeq 6.3^{\circ}$.

In principle with small angle scattering  both information on size as well as shape of the scatterer
and information on the relative arrangement of the scatterer can be obtained. In the following an
overview of the theoretical basics to analyze small angle scattering data will be given.

In section \ref{crosssection} the scattering of an ensemble of atoms has been discussed. There
interference terms between the waves scattered by the individual atoms were important for the
differential scattering cross-section (eq. \ref{scatteq1} ,\ref{diffx}).
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}}) = \frac{1}{N} \, {\left\vert \right\vert}{\sum_{j=1}^N\, b_j\,
e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}_j}}^2 \qquad \,\mbox{ or} \qquad
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}}) = \frac{1}{N} {\left\vert \right\vert}{\sum_{j=1}^{N}
f_{a,j}({\underline{ Q}})\, e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}}}^2  .
\end{equation}
Small angle scattering normally does not resolve dimension down to atomic dimensions.
Therefore the summation over the individual atoms can be replaced by an integration
over the illuminated volume $V$:
\begin{equation}
\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}({\underline{ Q}}) = \frac{1}{N}\, {\left\vert \right\vert}{\int_V d{\underline{ r}}\,
\rho({\underline{ r}})\, e^{\imath {\underline{ Qr}}}}^2 = \frac{1}{N}\, I({\underline{ Q}}) \quad ,
\label{scatteq3}
\end{equation}
whereby $\rho({\underline{ r}})$ is the local scattering length density and $F({\underline{ Q}})$
the scattering amplitude. The differential scattering cross-section is mathematically
the square of the modulus of the Fourier transformation of the scattering length density.
The scattering length density $\rho({\underline{ r}})$ is proportional to the locally averaged
scattering potential $\bar V({\underline{ r}})$. Thats why equation \ref{scatteq3} is except a constant
identical to equation \ref{scatteringfunction}. The scattering intensity
$I({\underline{ Q}}) = {\left\vert z\right\vert}^2 = z\, z^*$ can therefore be written as
\begin{equation}
I({\underline{ Q}}) = \int \!\!\! \int d{\underline{ r}}_1\, d{\underline{ r}}_2\, \rho({\underline{ r}}_1) \, \rho^*({\underline{ r}}_2)
\, e^{\imath{\underline{ }}{Q(r_{\rm 1}-r_{\rm 2})}} \quad .
\end{equation}
By using the substitution ${\underline{ r}} = {\underline{ r}}_1 - {\underline{ r}}_2$ one get
\begin{equation}
I({\underline{ Q}}) = \int d{\underline{ r}} \, e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}}
\underbrace{ \int d{\underline{ r}}_1\, \rho({\underline{ r}}_1) \,
\rho^*({\underline{ r}}_1-{\underline{ r}}) }_{\displaystyle \Gamma({\underline{ r}}) =  \rho({\underline{ r}}) \circledast
\rho({\underline{ r}}) } = \int d{\underline{ r}}\, \Gamma({\underline{ r}})\, e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}}
\quad . \label{Gamma}
\end{equation}
$\Gamma({\underline{ r}})$ is the autocorrelation function\footnote{Normally
 the autocorrelation function is defined as
 $\rho ({\underline{ r}}) \circledast \rho ({\underline{ r}}) = \int\, d{\underline{ r}}_1\, \rho ({\underline{ r}}_1)\,
\rho^{*}({\underline{ r}}_1+{\underline{ r}})$, so that in fact $\Gamma ({\underline{ r}})$ should be
 $\Gamma ({\underline{ r}}) = \rho(-{\underline{ r}}) \circledast \rho (-{\underline{ r}})$.}
 In case of a real scattering length density eq. \ref{Gamma} is the convolution integral
 $\Gamma({\underline{ r}}) = \rho ({\underline{ r}}) * \rho ({\underline{ r}}) = \int\, d{\underline{ r}}_1\, \rho
({\underline{ r}}_1)\, \rho ({\underline{ r}}_1-{\underline{ r}})$ of the scattering length density and is called
 Patterson function\footnote{Here the Patterson function is defined as the autocorrelation
 of the scattering length density $\rho({\underline{ r}})$. Instead of defining the cross-section via
 a scattering length density as in \ref{Gamma} in neutron scattering the differential
 cross-section is often defined as
  ${d\sigma_{\rm coh}({\underline{ Q}})}/{d\Omega} = ({\sigma_{\rm coh}}/{4 \pi\,N})\, \int
d{\underline{ r}}\,  \rho({\underline{ r}}) \circledast \rho({\underline{ r}})
\,\exp(\imath{\underline{ Q}}{\underline{ r}})$, whereby $\sigma_{\rm coh} = 4 \pi\,
\overline{b}^2$ is the coherent cross-section and
$\rho({\underline{ r}})$ the particle number density. The Patterson function
is than the autocorrelation of the particle number density. This function is independent
of the scattering lengths and only dependent on the geometric arrangement of the scattering
centers. The Fourier transformation of the Patterson function is therefore sometimes
called Structure factor $S({\underline{ Q}})$ and is related in case of a static approximation to
the differential cross-section by the equation
$d\sigma_{\rm coh}({\underline{ Q}})/d\Omega = (\sigma_{\rm coh}/4\pi N)\, S({\underline{ Q}})$.}.

\subsection{Autocorrelation function $\Gamma({\underline{ r}})$ and $\gamma({\underline{ r}})$}

In the following we will make use of two simplifications. Firstly the scattering system
is assumed to be isotropic. Hereby the isotropy can have its origin both in the shape of the
scatterer or being a consequence of the temporal change of the particle orientation.
The consequence is that $\Gamma({\underline{ r}})$ only depends on the modulus of $r$
and $e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}}$ can be averaged over all orientations of ${\underline{ r}}$. (The second
simplification will follow further below)

\subsubsection{Isotropic averages}

If $\alpha$ is assigned to the angle between ${\underline{ Q}}$ and ${\underline{ r}}$ and if all orientations $\alpha$
are equal probable than the probability $p_{\alpha}\, d\alpha$ that ${\underline{ Q}}$ and ${\underline{ r}}$
include the angle $\alpha$ is equal to $\frac{1}{2}\, \sin\alpha\, d\alpha$.
\begin{equation}
p_{\alpha}\, d\alpha = \frac{2\, \pi\, R\, \sin\alpha}{4\, \pi\,R^2}\,
R\, d\alpha = \frac{\sin\alpha}{2} \, d\alpha
\end{equation}
The average of $e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}}$ over all orientations of ${\underline{ r}}$ is
\begin{eqnarray}
\overline{e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}}}^{~{\underline{ r}}}
&=&\int_0^{\pi}\, d\alpha\,\frac{\sin\alpha}{2}\, e^{\imath Qr\cos\alpha}
= \frac{\sin Qr}{Qr}
 \\
&=& \underbrace{\int_0^{\pi}\, d\alpha\, \frac{\sin\alpha}{2}\,
\cos(Q\,r\,\cos\alpha)}_{\rm symmetric~to~\alpha=\pi/2} + \imath
\underbrace{\int_0^{\pi}\, d\alpha\, \frac{\sin\alpha}{2}\,
\sin(Q\, r\, \cos\alpha)}_{{\rm antisymmetric~to~}\alpha=\pi/2~\Rightarrow~
= 0}  
\\
&=& 2 \int_0^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\, d\alpha\, \frac{\sin\alpha}{2}\,
\cos(Q\, r\, \cos\alpha)
= \frac{1}{Qr}\, \int_0^{Qr}\, du\, \cos u = \frac{\sin Qr}{Qr} 
\label{equalorientations}
\end{eqnarray}
and equation \ref{Gamma} is simplified to
\begin{equation}
I(Q) = \int dr\, 4\pi\, r^2\, \Gamma(r) \frac{\sin Qr}{Qr} \quad .
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Absence of long range order}

As a second simplification it will be assumed that long range order is absent.
The consequence is that the autocorrelation $\Gamma(r)$
becomes constant for large values of $r$. It converges to $\bar\Gamma = \bar \rho^2 V$.
$\bar \rho$ is the average scattering length density defined by
\begin{equation}
\int \, d{\underline{ r}}\, \left( \rho({\underline{ r}}) - \bar\rho \right) = \int\,
d{\underline{ r}}\, \eta({\underline{ r}}) = 0
\label{barrho} \quad .
\end{equation}
Structural information is therefore only contained in a finite range of
$\Gamma({\underline{ r}})$ where it deviates from the average value $\bar \Gamma$.
This is due to the fact that only  a deviation of $\eta({\underline{ r}})$
from the average $\bar \rho$ leads to a scattering contribution for
$Q\not= 0$. An additional constant value $\bar \rho$ only contributes to the scattering
at $Q=0$ and is therefore not accessible.
Consequently the average scattering length density can be subtracted without loss of generality
and only deviations $\eta({\underline{ r}}) = \rho({\underline{ r}}) - \bar\rho$
have to be considered. The autocorrelation function is therefore defined as
\begin{eqnarray}
 \gamma(r) &=&
 \frac{1}{V}\,\overline{\eta({\underline{ r}}) \circledast \eta({\underline{ r}})}^{~{\underline{ r}}}
=\frac{1}{V}\,\overline{(\rho({\underline{ r}})-\bar\rho)\circledast
                        (\rho({\underline{ r}})-\bar\rho)}^{~{\underline{ r}}}
\\[2mm]
\Rightarrow \quad
I(Q) &=& V \int_0^{\infty} dr \, 4\pi\, r^2\, \gamma(r) \,\frac{\sin Qr}{Qr} .
\label{IQofgamma}
\end{eqnarray}
$V\gamma ({\underline{ r}})$ is different from $\Gamma({\underline{ r}})$ due to the definition of
$\bar \rho$ (eq. \ref{barrho}) only by a constant term $\bar\rho^2\,V$, i.e. $V\,\gamma({\underline{ r}}) =
\Gamma({\underline{ r}})-\bar\rho^2\,V$ because
\begin{eqnarray}
\Gamma({\underline{ r}}) &=&
\int\, d{\underline{ r}}_1\, \rho({\underline{ r}}_1)\, \rho^{*}({\underline{ r}}_1-{\underline{ r}}) =
\int\, d{\underline{ r}}_1\, (\bar\rho +\eta({\underline{ r}}_1))(\bar\rho + \eta({\underline{ r}}_1-{\underline{ r}}))^{*} \\
&=& \bar\rho^2 V +
\underbrace{\int\, d{\underline{ r}}_1\, (\bar\rho\,  \eta({\underline{ r}}_1)+
\bar\rho^{*}\, \eta^{*}({\underline{ r}}_1-{\underline{ r}}))}_{\mbox{= 0 ~due to def. of $\eta({\underline{ r}})$ in eq. \ref{barrho}}}
+ \int\, d{\underline{ r}}_1\, \eta({\underline{ r}}_1) \, \eta^{*}({\underline{ r}}_1-{\underline{ r}}) \\
&=& \bar\rho^2 V + \gamma({\underline{ r}})\, V
.
\end{eqnarray}

\subsubsection{Limits $r=0$ and $r=\infty$}

The limits $r=0$ and $r\rightarrow\infty$ for the autocorrelation $\gamma({\underline{ r}})$ are
$\gamma(0) = \overline{\eta^2}$ and $\gamma(\infty)=0$.
The limit $r\rightarrow\infty$ is zero because $\eta({\underline{ r}})$ is defined as the deviation
of the average scattering length density $\bar\rho$. As long range correlation is assumed
not to be present  $\eta({\underline{ r}}) \circledast \eta({\underline{ r}})
\stackrel{r\rightarrow\infty}{=} \bar \eta^2=0$.
$\gamma(r)$ can be calculated by the inverse Fourier transformation of the scattering
intensity $I(Q)$ (eq. \ref{IQofgamma})
\begin{equation}
V \, \gamma(r) = \frac{1}{2\pi^2} \, \int_0^{\infty} dQ\, Q^2\, I(Q)\,
\frac{\sin Qr}{Qr} \quad .
\label{gamma}
\end{equation}
An important special case is $r=0$ for which equation \ref{gamma} can be simplified to
\begin{equation}
V\, \gamma(0) %= V\,\int\,d{\underline{ r}}\, \eta^2({\underline{ r}})
              = V\, \overline{\eta^2}
              =  \frac{1}{2\pi^2} \int_0^{\infty} dQ\, Q^2 \,I(Q)
              = \frac{\tilde Q}{2\pi^2} \quad .
\label{gamma0}
\end{equation}
The integration of the intensity $I(Q)$ in reciprocal space is therefore directly related
to the average quadratic deviation of the scattering length density $\overline{\eta^2}$
but independent to the shape of the scatterers. If for example the scattering particle undergoes
deformation the scattering pattern may change drastically but the integral $\tilde Q$ in eq.
\ref{gamma0} keeps invariant against such a deformation.

\subsection{Volume fraction}
The average quadratic deviation of the scattering length density is directly related
in a two-phase system to the scattering contrast $\Delta\eta$ and volume fraction $f_p$ of one
or the other $(1-f_p)$ phase. The average quadratic deviation of the scattering length density
is defined as
\begin{equation}
\overline{\eta^2} = \eta_1^2 \, f_p + \eta_2^2\, (1-f_p) ,
\label{eta2bar}
\end{equation}
whereby $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ are the scattering length density differences of the two
phases from the average value $\bar\rho$ and the scattering contrast is than defined as
$\Delta\eta = \eta_1+\eta_2$. The average value $\bar\rho$ is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
\bar\rho = (\bar\rho-\eta_1)f_p + (\bar\rho+\eta_2)(1-f_p)
&\Leftrightarrow& f_p\, (\eta_1+\eta_2) = f_p\, \Delta\eta=\eta_2 \\

&{\rm or}& (1-f_p)\, \Delta\eta = \eta_1 \quad .

\end{eqnarray}
Replacing $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$ in eq.\ \ref{eta2bar} leads to
\begin{equation}
\overline{\eta^2}=\Delta\eta^2 \, f_p (1-f_p).
\end{equation}
The second moment of the scattering intensity, the so-called scattering invariant
$\tilde{Q}$ from eq.\ \ref{gamma0}, can therefore be related to the volume fractions of
the two phases $f_p$ and $(1-f_p)$ by
\begin{equation}
\tilde{Q} = \int dQ \,Q^2\, I(Q) = 2\pi^2\,V\,\Delta\eta^2\,f_p(1-f_p)
\label{Invariante}
\quad .
\end{equation}
Due to the Babinet principle in a scattering experiment the volume fractions can not be
uniquely assigned to one or the other phase. A system with exchanged phases would have the same invariant
A unique solution of eq.\ \ref{Invariante} for the volume fraction can only be obtained
if either one already knows from somewhere else that the volume fraction of one phase is much smaller than
the volume fraction of the other (dilute case) or if time resolved experiments are performed during the
formation of the structure and when it is known that one phase is growing on the cost of the other one
(Ostwald ripening).


\subsection{Interparticle interferences}
\label{chap:Interpartikelinterferenzen}
The square of the Fourier transformation of the scattering length density
of a sample with a volume $V$ is equal to the scattering intensity
$I({\underline{ Q}})$
\begin{equation}
I({\underline{ Q}}) = {\left\vert \right\vert}{\int_V\, d{\underline{ r}}\, \rho({\underline{ r}})\, e^{\imath
{\underline{ Qr}}}}^2 \quad .
\end{equation}
The integration has to be carried out over the whole illuminated sample volume $V$.
If the sample volume contains $N$ particles embedded in a matrix with a constant
scattering length density $\rho_M$ and if  ${\underline{ R}}_i$ defines the center of particle $i$
with a constant scattering length density  $\rho_{P,i} = \Delta\eta_i +
\rho_M$ the scattering intensity can be written as
\begin{eqnarray}
I({\underline{ Q}}) &=& {\left\vert \right\vert}{\sum_{i=1}^N\, F_i({\underline{ Q}})\, e^{\imath{\underline{ Q\,R}}_i}}^2
\label{masterIQ}\\
\,\mbox{ with~~~} F_i({\underline{ Q}}) &=& \int\limits_{V_i({\underline{ R}}_i)} d{\underline{ r}}\, \Delta\eta_i\,
e^{\imath{\underline{ Q}}({\underline{ r-R}}_i)} = \Delta\eta_i\, \int\limits_{V_i({\underline{ 0}})} d{\underline{ r}} \,
e^{\imath{\underline{ Qr}}} = \Delta\eta_i\, V_i \, f_i({\underline{ Q}}). 
\end{eqnarray}
$V_i({\underline{ R}}_i)$ describes the integration volume of scatterer $i$ located at
${\underline{ R}}_i$ and $V_i({\underline{ 0}})$ describes the integration volume of the scatterer $i$ moved
to the origin of the coordinate system. $\Delta\eta_i$ and $V_i$
are the scattering contrast and particle volume, respectively.
The square of the modulus in eq.\  \ref{masterIQ} can be rewritten to
\begin{eqnarray} 
I({\underline{ Q}}) &=& \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j=1}^N\, F_i({\underline{ Q}})\, F_j^{*}({\underline{ Q}})\,
e^{\imath {\underline{ Q}}{\underline{ R}}_{ij}} \\
&=& \sum_{i=1}^N {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_i({\underline{ Q}})}^2 +  \\
&&

\sin{\underline{ Q}}{\underline{ R}}_{ij} \right]}_{\,\mbox{ }{$\Psi({\underline{ Q}})$}}
\label{DefPsi}
\end{eqnarray}
The first term for which $i=j$ the phase factor is identical to 1 and describes the
sum of the scattering intensity of individual particles. The double sum in the second term
describes interference effects of the scattering amplitudes scattered from different particles which
depends on their relative arrangement ${\underline{ R}}_{ij} = {\underline{ R}}_i-{\underline{ R}}_j$.
The scattering amplitude $F_i({\underline{ Q}})$ is among other things dependent on the scattering contrast
 $\Delta\eta_i$ and on the normalized form factor
$F_i({\underline{ Q}}) / \Delta\eta_i V_i = f_i({\underline{ Q}})$,
whereby $f_i({\underline{ Q}})$ is a real-valued function with $f_i(Q=0)=1$.
Analytical expressions for scattering intensities $i_0(Q) = \overline{{\left\vert f(Q)\right\vert}^2}$
of simple geometric bodies are listed in the appendix \ref{ch:scattint}.
In case $\Delta\eta_i$ is complex valued, i.e. the scatterer has an absorption contrast
$\Delta\eta_i''$, the scattering contrast can be written as $\Delta\eta_i =
\Delta\eta_i' + \imath\Delta\eta_i''$ and for the interference term we get
\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi({\underline{ Q}}) &=& 2 \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j>i}^N\, f_i({\underline{ Q}})\, f_j({\underline{ Q}})\,
V_i\, V_j\, \\
&& 
\times \left[
(\Delta\eta_i'\, \Delta\eta_j'  + \Delta\eta_i''\,\Delta\eta_j'')
\, \cos{\underline{ Q}}{\underline{ R}}_{ij} -
(\Delta\eta_i'\, \Delta\eta_j'' - \Delta\eta_i''\,\Delta\eta_j' )
\, \sin{\underline{ Q}}{\underline{ R}}_{ij}
\right] \quad .
\end{eqnarray}
If now all particle have an identical scattering contrast
$\Delta\eta=\Delta\eta_i=\Delta\eta_j$ we get for the scattering intensity
 (eq.\ \ref{masterIQ}) the expression
\begin{eqnarray} 
I({\underline{ Q}}) &=&
\sum_{i=1}^N\,V_i^2\, (\Delta\eta'^2+\Delta\eta''^2)\, {\left\vert \right\vert}{f_i({\underline{ Q}})}^2 \\
&& + 2 \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j>i}^N\, f_i({\underline{ Q}})\, f_j({\underline{ Q}})\, V_i\, V_j\,
(\Delta\eta'^2 + \Delta\eta''^2) \, \cos{\underline{ Q}}{\underline{ R}}_{ij} \quad .
\end{eqnarray}
For identical scattering contrasts there is consequently no interference between
the scattering amplitude of waves scattered at the real and at the imaginary (absorption)
part of the scattering contrast.

\subsubsection{Isotropic ensemble of particles}

In the following we assume as another simplification an isotropic ensemble of particles.
Such a system of scatterer is defined as follows:
If ${\underline{ R}}_i$ defines the position of any particle  $i$ and
${\underline{ R}}_{ij}$ is the difference vector between the position of particle $i$ and $j$
than a system of particles is called isotropic if all vectors ${\underline{ R}}_{ij}$ of the same length will take
with equal probability any direction. Under this simplification the interference term
$\Psi({\underline{ Q}})$ in eq.\  \ref{DefPsi} can be averaged over all directions ${\underline{ R}}_{ij}$.
This average yield for
$\overline{\sin{\underline{ QR}}_{ij}}^{~{\underline{ R}}_{ij}}=0$ and for
$\overline{\cos{\underline{ QR}}_{ij}}^{~{\underline{ R}}_{ij}} =  \frac{\sin QR_{ij}}{QR_{ij}}$
(compare with eq.\ \ref{equalorientations}). The interference term can then be written as
\begin{equation}
\Psi({\underline{ Q}}) =
2 \sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j>i}^N\, f_i({\underline{ Q}})\, f_j({\underline{ Q}})\,
V_i\, V_j\,
(\Delta\eta_i'\, \Delta\eta_j'  + \Delta\eta_i''\,\Delta\eta_j'')
\, \frac{\sin QR_{ij}}{QR_{ij}} .
\end{equation}
Therefore also for an isotropic ensemble of scatterers no interferences between waves scatterer
at the real and imaginary part of the scattering contrast appears as already shown for systems of
particles with identical scattering contrast.

\subsection{Influence of the relative arrangement of scatterers on interparticle interferences}

The expression for $\Psi({\underline{ Q}})$ can be further simplified if the scattering system
consist of identical particles which fulfill the condition that for all of them
each orientation be likewise probable and furthermore the relative position of two particles
do not have an influence on their orientation.
The second part of the assumption is for radial symmetric particle automatically fulfilled.
However, in case of a system of close packed ellipsoidal particles with half axis $R$,
$R$ and $\nu R$ with $\nu>1$ distance of $2R$ between the centers of the ellipsoids are possible,
but for such an arrangement not all orientations of the ellipsoids are allowed anymore.
That means that the relative distance has an influence on allowed orientations of the particles.
The general case without the restrictions made in this paragraph are discussed by Guinier and
Fournet in \cite{book:Guinier:Fournet}. For only slightly anisotropic and not to closely packed
systems the assumptions made here are at least fulfilled in first approximation. Under the made
assumptions the averaging over the particle orientations can be separated from the averaging of the
particle positions. As a result from the average one gets for the scattering intensity
\begin{equation}
\overline{I(Q)} = N \overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2} + 2\, {\left\vert \right\vert}{\overline{F(Q)}}^2\,
\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j>i}^N\, \frac{\sin QR_{ij}}{QR_{ij}}
\label{Mittel}
\end{equation}
For low concentrations this averaging is in first approximation also valid for particles with a
size distribution.
The probability to find a particle at the position ${\underline{ R}}_i$ is in average
 $\frac{N}{V}\, d{\underline{ R}}_i$ and the probability to find at the same time another particle at position
 ${\underline{ R}}_j$ is $\frac{N}{V}\, d{\underline{ R}}_i\, \frac{N}{V}\,
d{\underline{ R}}_j$. A deviation from this is considered by $P(R_{ij})$
so that the double sum in eq.\  \ref{Mittel} can be written as
\begin{equation}
\sum_{i=1}^N\sum_{j>i}^N\, \frac{\sin QR_{ij}}{QR_{ij}} = \int_V \!\!
\int_V \frac{\sin Q R_{ij}}{Q R_{ij}}\, P(R_{ij}) \, \frac{N^2}{V^2}\,
d{\underline{ R}}_i\, d{\underline{ R}}_j \quad .
\end{equation}
For isotropic media the function $P(R_{ij})$ is independent of the indices $i$
and $j$ and only a function of the distance R. $P(R)$ has the property to converge for
large distance against one. By the substitution $P(R) = 1-(1-P(R))$ one gets for the
interference term
\begin{eqnarray}
\Psi(Q) &=& {\left\vert \right\vert}{\overline{F(Q)}}^2 \frac{N^2}{V^2}
\int_V\!\! \int_V \frac{\sin QR_{ij}}{QR_{ij}} \,
d{\underline{ R}}_i\, d{\underline{ R}}_j \\
&-& {\left\vert \right\vert}{\overline{F(Q)}}^2 \frac{N^2}{V^2}
\int_V\!\!\int_V \frac{\sin QR_{ij}}{QR_{ij}}
(1-P(R_{ij})) \, d{\underline{ R}}_i\, d{\underline{ R}}_j
 .
\end{eqnarray}
The first term can be interpreted as the scattering of a particle with the
volume $V$ and the average scattering contrast $\overline{F(Q)}\frac{N}{V}$.
As the illuminated sample volume $V$ is relatively large this contribution is
practically zero for all experimental accessible scattering angles.
As for isotropic media the integration over $d{\underline{ R}}_i$ is independent from the
integration over $d{\underline{ R}}_j$ and $(1-P(R))$ quickly converges against zero the
first integrationin the second term (neglecting side effects) can be written as
\begin{equation}
\int_0^{\infty} dR\, \frac{\sin QR}{QR}\, (1-P(R))\, \frac{N^2}{V^2}\,
4\, \pi\,R^2.
\end{equation}
The second integration only yields an additional multiplication factor $V$.
Finally one gets for the scattering intensity the expression
\begin{equation}
\overline{I(Q)} = N\, \left\{
\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2} - {\left\vert \right\vert}{\overline{F(Q)}}^2\,
\underbrace{\frac{N}{V}\, \int dR\, 4\pi\, R^2\, (1-P(R)) \,
            \frac{\sin QR}{QR}}_{\Upsilon(Q)} \right\} \quad .
\label{eq:generalPrinsZernicke}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Formula from Prins and Zernicke}

For radial symmetric identical scatterer the quare of the average form factor
${\left\vert \right\vert}{\overline{F(Q)}}^2$ and the average of the squared form factor $\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2}$
are the same so that one get for the expression from Prins and Zernicke \cite{scatt163}
and from Debye und Mencke \cite{scatt186}
\begin{equation}
\overline{I(Q)} = N\, F^2(Q)\,
\underbrace{\left\{ 1 - \frac{N}{V}\, \int\, dR\, 4\pi\,R^2\, (1-P(R))\,
                        \frac{\sin QR}{QR} \right\}
           }_{S(Q) = 1 - \Upsilon(Q)} \quad .
\label{eq:originalPrinsZernicke}
\end{equation}
The problem of applying eq.\ \ref{eq:generalPrinsZernicke} or \ref{eq:originalPrinsZernicke}
is the evaluation of $P(R)$. $P(R)$ depends on the geometric arrangement of the scatterer.
For liquid emulsions the geometric arrangement can be related to thermodynamic quantities like
concentration, temperature and interaction potential between the particles.
In a theory of Raman \cite{scatt188} the geometric arrangement is associated to the interaction
potential  $U(r)$ in a simple way. According to his theory the potential is the sum of two-body
interactions and he finds for $P(r)$ the relation $P(r) = \exp (-U(r)/kT)$.
For larger concentrations many-body interactions have to be taken into account.
In a more general theory of Born and Green \cite{scatt142} three-body interactions are at least
considered in first approximation and they find for the scattering intensity the expression
\begin{eqnarray}
\overline{I(Q)} &=& N\, \left\{\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2} + {\left\vert \right\vert}{\overline{F(Q)}}^2
          \, \frac{\chi(Q)}{\frac{V}{N}\, (2\pi)^{-3/2} - \chi(Q)} \right\}
\label{eq:Interferenzen:Potential} \\
\mbox{with~~~~} \chi(Q) &=& \sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi}} \int_0^\infty dr\,
\left[ e^{-U(r)/kT} - 1\right]\, r^2\, \frac{\sin Qr}{Qr} 
.
\end{eqnarray}
For a simple hard sphere model with the interaction potential
$U(r) = \left\{ { ~0 \mbox{\scriptsize ~for~} r > 2 R \atop
              \infty \mbox{\scriptsize ~for~} r \leq 2 R}
           \right. $
the scattering intensity can be calculated analytically.
According to Raman's theory Debye calculates for the scattering intensity of spheres
with a radius $R$ and a volume $V_P$ the expression
\begin{equation}
\overline{I(Q)} = N\, K^2(QR)\,
       \left\{ 1 - 8\, N\, \frac{V_P}{V}\, K(2QR) \right\},
\end{equation}
whereby $K(x)$ is the scattering function of a sphere given in appendix \ref{ch:scattint}.
Following the theory of Born and Green one gets a similar expression
\begin{equation}
\overline{I(Q)} = N\, K^2(QR)\,
       \left\{ 1 + 8\, N\, \frac{V_P}{V}\, K(2QR) \right\}^{-1}.
\end{equation}
Nonetheless both theories are only valid for monodisperse systems of scatterer.
In practice, however, most scattering systems have a more or less pronounced size distribution
and frequently also an additional variety of shapes. For such systems the interaction potential
can not be expressed in a closed form. One has to introduce for each pair of particle type a separate
potential \cite{scatt97} which complicates the analytical treatment a lot.

\subsubsection{Isolate particles}

A system of isolate particles is characterized by its property that the positions of a particle is not influenced
by the positions of any other particle. For this case the interaction potential $U(r)$ and consequently also  $\chi(Q)$
is identical zero. Therefore the expression for the scattering intensity simplifies to
\begin{equation}
               I(Q) = N\, \overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2}
\quad \mbox{or} \quad  I({\underline{ Q}}) = \sum_{i=1}^{N} {\left\vert \right\vert}{F_i({\underline{ Q}})}^2 .
\end{equation}
The total scattering intensity is simply the sum of the intensity scattered by the individual particles.
A system of non-interacting particles can be realized by diluting the system. Thereby the average distance
between the particles is increased and the interaction potential becomes negligible small and does not
influence anymore the arrangement of the scatterer.

\subsubsection{Polydisperse System of isolated particles}

The scattering function of a polydisperse system of isolated
particles is determined by the shape and size of the particles. In
a scattering experiment it is not possible to separate both
quantities at the same time. In the data analysis one has to
assume one of the quantities either the shape or the size
distribution to get then the other quantity. Normally the shape is
assumed whereby the size distribution is than obtained from the
scattering curve \cite{scatt75,scatt121}. To get an information
about the shape one normally need a system of identical particles,
like for example a system of identical proteins. An additional but
known size distribution would smear out the scattering too much to
still allow to extract confidential information about the particle
shape. The scattering intensity of a system of isolated particles
of different shape and a size distribution is given by
\begin{equation} I({\underline{ Q}}) = \sum_{\mu=1}^M \int N_{\mu}(R) \,
           \overline{{\left\vert \right\vert}{F_{\mu}(Q,R)}^2} \, dR ,
\label{eq:N(R)F(QR)}
\end{equation}
whereby $N_{\mu}(R)$ is the size distribution of particles of type $\mu$
and  $F_{\mu}(Q,R)$ its form factor. Form factor of simple objects are
listed in appendix \ref{ch:scattint} and frequently used size distributions
in appendix \ref{ch:distrib}.

\subsection{Influence of $N(R)$ and $F(Q,R)$ on interparticle interferences}
\label{chap:Einfluss:N(R):F(Q)}

Interparticle interferences in small angle scattering signals have been described in
eq.\  \ref{eq:generalPrinsZernicke}  and \ref{eq:originalPrinsZernicke} by
\begin{equation}
\overline{I(Q)} % &=& N\,\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2} + N\,{\left\vert \right\vert}{\overline{F(Q)}}^2\,
                % (S(Q)-1) \label{eq:Mittelwert:Einfluss}\\
= N\,\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2} \left\{1 +
 \frac{{\left\vert \right\vert}{\overline{F(Q)}}^2}{\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2}} \, (S(Q)-1) \right\}
\label{eq:Mittelwert:Einfluss}
\end{equation}
Hereby $S(Q)$ describes the influence of the relative arrangement of the
scatterers on $\overline{I(Q)}$ and can be calculated by the interaction
potential between the scattering particles (eq.\ \ref{eq:Interferenzen:Potential}).
Interparticle interferences depends next to the relative arrangement also
on the square of the average form factor {\small $\vert{\overline{F(Q)}}\vert^2$}.
Only for the case of identical and spherical symmetric scatterer the relation
{\small $\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2} \equiv \vert{\overline{F(Q)}}\vert^2$} is valid.
In this case the interparticle interferences only depends on $S(Q)$. For particles
with an irregular shape, however, the two averages are different and depends both on
the size distribution as well as on the particle shape and their orientation distribution.
For such systems the condition for the derivation the relation from Prins and Zernicke
\ref{eq:generalPrinsZernicke} namely the independency of orientation and size for higher
concentrations is not anymore fulfilled. This condition allowed in eq.\ \ref{Mittel}
to separate the averaging of the particle positions from the averaging of the form factor.
Nevertheless the principle influence of a irregular particle shape and a size distribution
can be made clear by the means of eq.\ \ref{eq:Mittelwert:Einfluss}.
For judging their influence the ratio
{\small $\vert{\overline{F(Q)}}\vert^2/\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2}$} is considered.

Taking for example a system of identical but random oriented rotational ellipsoids
with the half axis $R$, $R$, $\nu R$ the ratio of the two averages
is shown in figure \ref{fig:formfactor:interferenzen} together with the scattering
intensity {\small $\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2}$} of the corresponding ideal dilutes system.
The derivation of the formula for calculating  {\small $\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2}$} and
{\small $\vert{\overline{F(Q)}}\vert^2$} are given in appendix \ref{ch:anisotrop:form}.
The figure shows that the ratio decreases for larger scattering vectors $Q$
the more the shaper of the rotational ellipsoid is different from the ideal spherical
case ($\nu=1$). An irregular particle shape already is sufficient to reduce the influence
interparticle interferences.

Accordingly also the particle size distribution give rise to a difference
in the averages {\small $\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2}$} and {\small $\vert{\overline{F(Q)}}\vert^2$}.
Figure \ref{fig:formfactor:interferenzen}b shows the ratio of the two averages
of spherical scatterers with a lognormal size distribution of different width as a
function of $Q$.  For $Q=0$ the ratio is given by
{\small $\vert{\overline{F(Q)}}\vert^2/\overline{{\left\vert F(Q)\right\vert}^2} = \exp(-9\sigma^2)$}.
One can see that the width of the size distribution strongly reduces the interference effect
\cite{scatt151}.

In general one can say that each kind of disorder reduces interferences.
The disorder can have its origin in a random arrangement of particles
(dilute systems), in an orientation distribution of irregular shaped particles,
or also in a size ditsribution.

these interference effects.}

\subsection{Scattering laws and structural parameter}

In this section a series of useful scattering laws are presented, which
are useful for a simple analysis of experimental data and which allow an
easy determination of structural parameters.
\cite{book:Guinier:Fournet}.

\subsubsection{Porod volume}

The ratio of the scattering intensity in forward direction $I(Q=0)=N\,
V_P^2\, \Delta\eta^2$ and the scattering invariant  $\tilde Q =
2\pi^2\Delta\eta^2\, V\, f_p(1-f_p)$ can be used to determine the particle volume $V_P$
($V$ describes the illuminated sample volume).
$f_p\, V = N\, V_P$ corresponds to the total volume of all scatterers
whereby the particle volume $V_P$ can be calculated by
\begin{equation}
\frac{V_P}{1-f_p} \, \stackrel{f_p \ll 1}{\simeq} \,  V_P
        = 2\pi^2\, \frac{I(Q=0)}{\tilde Q} .
\end{equation}
The measurement of the scattering curve in relative units is therefore sufficiant
to determine the volume of a homogeneous scatterer. Sources of errors for this way
of determination of particle sizes are the extrapolation into forward direction und
more important the extrapolation to large scattering angles
($Q^{-4}$-extrapolation). Furthermore for large volume fractions $f_p$
the particle volume has to be eventually corrected by a prefactor
$1/(1-f_p)$ which is not always known.

\subsubsection{Radius of gyration and Guinier approximation}


The scattering intensity for small angles can be approximated in a series expansion
by replacing the expression $\frac{\sin Qr}{Qr}$ in eq.\ \ref{IQofgamma}
by a McLaurin series which leads to
\begin{equation}
I(Q) = V\, \int 4\pi\, r^2\, \gamma(r)\,
       \left[1-\frac{Q^2r^2}{3!} + \frac{Q^4r^4}{5!} - \dots \right] \, dr
       \quad ,
\end{equation}
i.e.\ $I(Q)$ is expanded by moments $\overline{r^n}$ of $\gamma(r)$.
The first term corresponds to the scattering intensity of $Q=0$.
For the second term Guinier and Fournet \cite{book:Guinier:Fournet}
have shown, that it can be related to the gyration radius of the scattering length density
$R_G$ by
\begin{equation}
V\,\int 4\pi\, r^2\, \frac{Q^2r^2}{3!}\, \gamma(r)\, dr = I(0)\,
         \frac{Q^2R_G^2}{3}
     \quad \Rightarrow \quad
   I(Q) = I(0) \, \left( 1-\frac{Q^2R_G^2}{3} \right)
\end{equation}
with $R_G^2 = \int \eta(r)\, r^2\, dr/\int \eta(r)\, dr$.
Up to the term of $Q^4$ this series expansion at the beginning of the scattering curve
is identical to the series expansion of an exponential function which than leads to
the well known Guinier approximation
\begin{equation}
I(Q) = I(0)\, e^{-Q^2R_G^2/3} .
\label{eq:Guinier}
\end{equation}
The Guinier law is valid for any particle shape which is roughly
isodiametric. For flat or elongated structures the Guinier law has to be
corrected slightly \cite{book:Feigin:Svergun,book:Guinier:Fournet}.
The radius of gyration for a sphere with radius $R$ is given by $R_G=\sqrt{3/5}\, R$.
The Guinier law is valid in the scattering vector interval $0<Q<1/R_G$.

\subsubsection{Correlation length}

Another characteristic quantity, which can be easily extracted from
the scattering curve $I(Q)$ is the correlation length $l_c$. The correlation length
is defined as the average width of the correlation function  $\gamma(r)$:
\begin{equation}
l_c = \frac{2}{\gamma(0)}\, \int \gamma(r) \, dr .
\end{equation}
Together with the definition of the scattering invariant $\tilde Q$ in
eq.\  \ref{Invariante} and the relation between $I(Q)$ and $\gamma(r)$ in
eq.\ \ref{gamma} this results after a short calculation (changing of
integrations) to
\begin{equation}
l_c = \pi\, \frac{\int Q\, I(Q)\, dQ}{\int Q^2\, I(Q)\, dQ} \quad .
\end{equation}
A sphere with radius $R$ has therefore a correlation length of $l_c = \frac{3}{2}\, R$.

\subsubsection{Porod law and specific surfaces}

The Porod law describes the scattering behavior at large $Q$ values.
As the scattering intensity $I(Q)$ and the correlation function $\gamma(r)$
are related via the Fourier transformation the intensity $I(Q)$ is determined
at large values of $Q$ mainly by $\gamma(r)$ at small $r$. For small $r$  the
correlation function $\gamma(r)$ can be expanded in a Taylor series and one
gets according to Guinier and Fournet \cite{book:Guinier:Fournet}
\begin{equation}
\frac{\gamma(r)}{\gamma(0)} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} \, \frac{S}{V} + \dots
\quad ,
\label{eq:gamma:Taylor}
\end{equation}
whereby $S$ is the total surface of all scatterer in the illuminated sample volume $V$.
Eq.\ \ref{eq:gamma:Taylor} together with \ref{IQofgamma} result for large
$Q$ values into the Porod law
\begin{equation}
I(Q) \longrightarrow \Delta\eta^2\, \frac{2\pi\, S}{Q^4} .
\label{eq:Porodlaw}
\end{equation}
A scaling of the scattering intensity on $\tilde Q$ provides an expression
for the specific surface $S/V$ of
\begin{equation}
\lim_{Q\rightarrow \infty} \, \pi\,\frac{I(Q)}{\tilde Q}\, Q^4\, f_p\,
(1-f_p) = \frac{S}{V} .
\label{eq:spez:surface}
\end{equation}
The Porod law can be applied to all systems having sharp interfaces.

\section{Correction and Normalization of SANS-Raw data}

A detector of a small angle scattering camera measures the
superposition of intensities of different origin:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Background noise $I_B$
\item Scattering of the empty sample holder $I_{H}$
\item scattering of the isolated sample $I_S$
\end{enumerate}
Furthermore the detector elements can have different efficiencies $\epsilon_i$.
To determine the differential cross-section of of the sample all the different
contribution to the total scattering intensity have to be considered and determined
separately by different measurements. The quantity to be known is the scattering
contribution of the isolated sample $I_S$, which in general can not be measured directly.
Experimental accessible scattering contributions are the scattering of the sample in the
sample holder $I_{S+H}$, the contribution of the empty sample holder $I_{H}$ and the
background noise $I_B$. From this experimental accessible data the wanted scattering
contribution of the isolated sample has to be determined.

\subsection{Contribution of the isolated sample}
The intensity of the incident beam will be attenuated by absorption
and scattering effects within the sample. Also the scattered neutrons
will be further attenuated on their residual path through the sample.
The measured intensity in a detector element  $i$ is given by
\begin{equation}
I^0_{S,i} = \int^d_0 dx\, \Phi_0\, \Delta \Omega_i\, \epsilon_i\,
e^{-\alpha\,x}\, A\, \rho \, e^{-\frac{\alpha(d-x)}{\cos\theta}}
\left\{ \frac{d\sigma_{\rm coh}}{d\Omega} + \frac{d\sigma_{\rm inc}}{d\Omega}
\right\}
.
\end{equation}
Hereby $d$ describes the sample thickness in cm, $\Phi_0$ the incident neutron
flux in neutrons per cm$^2\times$sec, $d\Omega_i$ is the solid angle of the detector
element $i$ in steradian, $\epsilon_i$ the detection efficiency of detector element
$i$ and $\alpha$ the extinction coefficient of the sample in cm$^{-1}$. $A$ the illuminated
sample area in cm$^2$. $\theta$ describes the angle between the wave vector  ${\bf k}_0$ of
the incident neutrons and the wave vector ${\bf k}$ of the scattered neutrons.
$\frac{d\sigma_{\rm coh}}{d\Omega}$ and
$\frac{d\sigma_{\rm inc}}{d\Omega}$ are the coherent and incoherent differential cross-sections,
respectively.
For small angle scattering $\cos\theta \simeq 1$ and one yields after integration
\begin{equation}
I^0_{S,i} = \Phi_0\, \Delta \Omega_i\, \epsilon_i\,
\underbrace{A\, \rho \,d}_{N_S}\, \underbrace{e^{-\alpha d}}_{T_S}
\left\{ \frac{d\sigma_{\rm coh}}{d\Omega} + \frac{d\sigma_{inc}}{d\Omega}
\right\}
.
\end{equation}
The quantity $N_S = A\, \rho\, d$ corresponds to the number of scattering
atoms and $T_S = e^{-\alpha\, d} = \frac{I_{\rm trans}}{I_0}$ to the transmissions
coefficient, which can be determined from the ration of the intensity of the
transmitted primary beam $I_{\rm trans}$ and the intensity of the incident beam
$I_0$. The incoherent scattering is isotropically and equally distributed over
the whole solid angle of  $4\pi$. Therefore one gets for $I^0_{S,i}$
\begin{equation}
I^0_{S,i} = \Phi_0\, \Delta \Omega_i\, \epsilon_i\,
\left\{ N_S\, T_S \, \frac{d\sigma_{\rm coh}}{d\Omega} + A\, \frac{1-T_S}{4\,
\pi} \right\} . \label{dsdotheo}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Correction for sample holder and background noise}
The scattering intensity of an isolated sample can practically never
measured directly. The scattering of the sample is always superposed
by scattering from the sample holder and by background noise. Background noise
is meant to be electronic noise, cosmic radiation, and detection of neutrons, which
have not passed through the sample like scattered neutrons from neighboring experiments.
Because of this reasons additional measurements have to be carried out, which are
a measurement of the empty sample holder $I_H$ and a measurement with a strong
absorber like Cadmium in front of the sample to measure the background noise $I_B$.
Together with the measurement of the sample in the sample holder $I_{S+H,i}$
 the scattering of the isolated sample $I^0_{S,i}$ on the detector element $i$ can
 be calculated by
\begin{equation}
I_{S,i}^0 = \left( \frac{I_{S+H,i}}{M_{S+H}} - \frac{I_{B,i}}{M_B} \right)
-
\frac{T_{S+H}}{T_H} \left(\frac{I_{H,i}}{M_{H}} - \frac{I_{B,i}}{M_B} \right) .
\label{dsdoexp}
\end{equation}
The index $B$ stands for \underline{b}ackground, $H$
for the empty sample \underline{h}older, $S+H$ for the sample in the sample holder and $S$
for the scattering of the isolated sample.
All intensities have to be normalized on the number of incident neutrons. This can be done
for example by division of the measured intensity my a monitor count rate $M$.
The factor $ \frac{T_{S+H}}{T_H}$ takes account for the attenuation of the beam by the sample.

The differential cross-section in eq.\ \ref{dsdotheo} can now be calculated from the measurable
intensities in eq.\ \ref{dsdoexp}. Nevertheless the quantities $\Phi_0$, $\Delta\Omega_i$ and
$\epsilon_i$ still have to be known. Furthermore $I_S^0$ is not given in physical standard units
but in units per monitor count. All this can be overcome by a comparison with a standard substance
$St$. Common standard materials are in general materials with a small coherent cross-section and a
large incoherent cross-section like vanadium or water. For both of these materials the coherent
cross-section is negligible small. The scattering intensities of the standard materials have to be
corrected in the same way than the sample itself according to eq.\ \ref{dsdoexp}. The ratio of both
intensities $I^0_{S,i}/I^0_{St,i}$ leads to
\begin{equation}
\frac{I^0_{S,i}}{I^0_{St,i}} = \frac{T_S\, N_S\, \displaystyle
\left(\frac{d\sigma_{\rm coh}}{d \Omega} +
\frac{d\sigma_{\rm inc}}{d\Omega} \right)}{T_{St}\,N_{St}\, \displaystyle
\frac{d\sigma^{St}_{\rm inc}}{d\Omega}}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
\Leftrightarrow \qquad \displaystyle
\frac{d\sigma_{\rm coh}}{d\Omega} + \frac{d\sigma_{\rm inc}}{d\Omega} =
\frac{I^0_{S,i}}{I^0_{St,i}} \, \frac{T_{St}\, N_{St}}{T_S\, N_S}\,
\displaystyle
\frac{d\sigma^{St}_{\rm inc}}{d\Omega}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \displaystyle
\mbox{or}\qquad
\frac{d\sigma_{\rm coh}}{d\Omega} + \frac{d\sigma_{\rm inc}}{d\Omega} =
\frac{I^0_{S,i}}{I^0_{St,i}} \, \frac{(1-T_{St})\, \displaystyle
\frac{A_{St}}{4\pi}}{T_S\, N_S} .
\end{equation}
If water is used as a standard the last formula has to be multiplied on the right
side with an empirical factor $f(\lambda,\sigma_t,T) \simeq 1$. This factor corrects for
the different efficiencies of the detector for different neutron energies. This correction
can become important in case of water because of it inelastic scattering behavior.

        \item[8.7.2009] {\tt SASfit } 0.91.1: Since the previous version of
                    {\tt SASfit } (0.90.1, January 2009) there were a lot of changes to
                    primarily improve the quality and portability of the code. Here is
                    only a short summary of the larger changes done:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item added detailed documentation on setup and installation of {\tt SASfit },
                  as well as plugin development (how to add own model functions)
            \item fixed some bugs in plugin framework

                  and 24.9 keV can be calculated.
            \item a few new form factor have been included:
                        \texttt{generalized Gaussian coil},

                        \texttt{ellCylShell2}
        \end{itemize}
    \item[12.01.2009]{\tt SASfit} 0.90.1 : bug-fix in plugin-GUI
    \item[5.01.2009] {\tt SASfit} 0.90:
    new release including full source code and binaries for
    windows and linux. Since the previous version of v (0.87, March 2008)
    there were a lot of changes to primarily improve the quality
    and portability of the code. Here only a short summary of the 'big'
    changes done (as of Dec. 17th, 2008):
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Structured the source code into the modules \texttt{sasfit\_common}, \texttt{sasfit\_sd}, \texttt{sasfit\_sq},
                \texttt{sasfit\_ff}, \texttt{sasfit\_core}.
        \item Switched to {\tt CMake} build environment for platform independence. Build and tested {\tt SASfit} on
                Linux and Windows, 32bit as well as 64bit.
        \item Replaced intensive string comparisons for model function selection in each iteration step by more reasonable
                selection of functions pointers at initialization time and direct call of the according function at iteration time.
        \item Fixed a lot of bugs and typos in the GUI (but there are still some)
        \item Added flexible plugin system for external model functions. This way, all model functions can be provided
                as plugins and though move out of the core algorithms. Also enables easy customization. In the future
                the modules \texttt{sasfit\_sd}, \texttt{sasfit\_sq}, \texttt{sasfit\_ff} and \texttt{sasfit\_peaks}
                will be converted to external plugins.
        \item Added \texttt{sasfit\_peaks}, a new class of model functions containing peaks.
        \item Added capability to ship {\tt SASfit} as standalone executable, allows running on system without the
                need of external libraries (e.g. Tcl, BLT, ...)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item[4.03.2008] ({\tt SASfit} version 0.87) The last
    modification in the menu navigation still had bugs. Hopefully
    they are removed in this version.
    \item[28.02.2008] ({\tt SASfit} version 0.86)
    The menu navigation has been debugged and optimized.
    Corrected a bug in calculating the polydispersity index (PDI)
    in DLS cumulant analysis (PDI=Gamma2/Gamma1$\hat{~}$2)
    \item[25.01.2008] ({\tt SASfit} version 0.85)
    A bug for the form factors  \texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a*} has
    been corrected. The implementation of the scaling
    approximation, partial structure factors and local monodisperse
    approach has been improved.
    \item[9.01.2008] ({\tt SASfit} version 0.84) Form factor for
    worm-like micelles (\texttt{WORM+Chains(RW), WORM+Chains(RW)\_Rc,
    WORM+Chains(RW)\_Nagg}) and for cluster aggregates
    (\texttt{Mass Fractal (Exp(-x) Cut-Off), Fisher-Burford,
    MassFractExp,MassFractGauss, Mass Fractal (Exp(-x$\hat{~}$a) Cut-Off), DLCAggregation,
    RLCAggregation, MassFractOverlappingSph} have been implemented. Furthermore a simple scheme for importing data
    from the clipboard has been implemented, which e.g. allows to copy/paste
    data from spread-sheets directly into {\tt SASfit}.
    Corrected a bug for the form factors  \texttt{ROD+R$\hat{~}$-a*}
    \item[4.10.2007] ({SPHERE+Chains(RW), SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Rc, SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Nagg\tt SASfit} version 0.80)
    Next to the correction of some bugs a simulation option for
    multiple data sets has been implemented. Furthermore an option has been implemented to subtract a
    theoretical scattering contribution from the experimental data set, like e.g. a constant background signal.
    The format of the project files have up to now never been tested for compatibility. An attempt has
    been started to change this for the future versions.
    \item[20.8.2007] A couple of form factors for spherical, elliptical, cylindrical and very long rod-like
    micelles consisting of a homogeneous core and which are either grafted with Gaussian chains \texttt{*(RW)*},
    or grafted with semi-flexible self-avoiding and interacting chains \texttt{*(SAW)*} or
    a corona with a power-law decaying profile $r^{-\alpha}$ \texttt{*(R$\hat{~}$-a)*}
    have been implemented:
    \texttt{
    SPHERE+Chains(RW), SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Rc, SPHERE+Chains(RW)\_Nagg,
    SPHERE+Chains(SAW), SPHERE+Chains(SAW)\_Rc, SPHERE+Chains(SAW)\_Nagg,

    }
    \item[30.6.2007] Rudimental copy algorithm to copy plots or parameters into window-clipboard. Everything
    is copied in wmf-format and the option only works fine for information in non-scrolled widgets.
    Copy-option can be activated with right mouse button or double click of left mouse button.

    \texttt{SphereWithGaussChains} and a slightly different parametrised form factor named
    \texttt{BlockCopolymerMicelle}.
    An additional option for reading ASCII data files is now available,
    which allows to convert values for the scattering vector from
    nm$^{-1}$ into \AA$^{-1}$ and vice versa. \sloppy
