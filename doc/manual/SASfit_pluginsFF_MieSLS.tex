\section{Lorenz-Mie Form Factors for Static Light Scattering}
\label{sect:LorenzMieSLS}

Mie theory, also called Lorenz-Mie theory \cite{Mie1908,Hulst1957,Bohren1983},
is a complete mathematical-physical theory of the scattering of electromagnetic
radiation by spherical particles. Mie theory is named after its
developer German physicist Gustav Mie (1868 Rostock - 1957
Freiburg im Breisgau) and Danish physicist Ludvig Lorenz
(1829-1891) who independently developed the theory of
electromagnetic plane wave scattering by a dielectric sphere in
1908.

%In contrast to Rayleigh scattering or Dipole scattering, Mie
%scattering embraces all possible ratios of diameter to wavelength.
%It assumes an homogeneous, isotropic and optically linear material
%irradiated by an infinitely extending plane wave.

Mie scattering describes the scattering of electromagnetic
radiation by spherical particles of any size $r$, relative to the
wavelength, $\lambda$. Since the cases $r \ll \lambda$ and $r \gg
\lambda$ are covered by Rayleigh (dipole) scattering and geometric
scattering theories, respectively, Mie scattering often refers to
the case of $r \sim \lambda$.

The Mie scattering formulae are given in several books (Van
de Hulst \cite{Hulst1957}, Kerker \cite{Kerker1969}, Deirmendjian, 1969) and by Dave \cite{Dave1969,Dave1968, Dave1969a}, although not always in the forms most suited to
computation. The algorithm used here is based on the MIEV0 package
described in \cite{Wiscombe1979,Wiscombe1980}.

The following input values are used:
\begin{align}
   \Theta &= 2\arcsin(Q\lambda/(4\pi)) \text{~with~} Q<Q_\text{max}=4\pi/\lambda  \nonumber \\
 R &= \text{radius of scattering sphere} \nonumber \\
 \lambda & = \text{wavelength of incident plane
 wave inside the solvent} \nonumber \\
m & = \text{complex refractive index of sphere relative to
surrounding medium} \nonumber \\
  & = m_\text{re} - i m_\text{im} \nonumber \\
  & \vert m \vert \geq 1 \text{~and~} m_\text{im} \geq 0 \nonumber \\
  & \text{or} \nonumber \\
  &  \vert m\vert  < 1 \text{~and~} m_\text{im} = 0 \nonumber \\
  \text{pol} & = 0 \text{~ unpolarized light} \nonumber \\
  \text{pol} & = 1 \text{~ parallel to scattering plane polarized light} \nonumber \\
  \text{pol} & = -1 \text{~ perpendicular to scattering plane polarized light} \nonumber
 \end{align}
 $\vert m\vert < 1$ would, for example, include visible light scattering from air
 bubbles in water.

This form factor is basing on the version of MieLay, which
computes electromagnetic scattering by a stratified sphere, i.e. a
particle consisting of a spherical core surrounded by a spherical
shell.  The surrounding medium is assumed to have refractive index
unity. The formulas, manipulated to avoid the ill-conditioning
that plagued earlier formulations, were published
in \cite{Toon1981}.

output  arguments, is inside the single precision version of this

  & \vert m_\text{c} \vert \geq 1 \text{~and~} m_\text{c,im} \geq 0 \nonumber \\
  & \text{or} \nonumber \\
  &  \vert m_\text{c}\vert  < 1 \text{~and~} m_\text{c,im} = 0 \nonumber \\
m_\text{s} & = \text{complex refractive index of core relative to
surrounding medium} \nonumber \\
  & = m_\text{s,re} - i m_\text{s,im} \nonumber \\
  \text{pol} & = 0 \text{~ unpolarized light} \nonumber \\
