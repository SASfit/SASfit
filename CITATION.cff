abstract: >-
  Small-angle scattering is an increasingly common
  method for characterizing particle ensembles in a
  wide variety of sample types and for diverse areas
  of application. SASfit has been one of the most
  comprehensive and flexible curve-fitting programs
  for decades, with many specialized tools for
  various fields.
