.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
\fBTcl_PutEnv\fR sets an environment variable. The information is
passed in a single string of the form NAME=value.  This procedure is
intended to be a stand-in for the UNIX \fBputenv\fR system call. All
tcl-based applications using \fBputenv\fR should redefine it to
\fBTcl_PutEnv\fR so that they will interface properly to the Tcl
runtime.

.SH KEYWORDS
environment, variable
