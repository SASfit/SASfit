2013-05-19  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4:     Fix for FreeBSD, and remove support for older
	* unix/configure:  FreeBSD versions. Patch by Pietro Cerutti.

2013-05-16  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Add panic in order to detect
	incompatible mingw32 sys/stat.h and sys/time.h headers,

2013-05-06  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclStubInit.c: Add support for Cygwin64, which has a 64-bit
	* generic/tclDecls.h: "long" type. Binary compatibility with win64
	requires that all stub entries use 32-bit long's, therefore the
	need for various wrapper functions/macros. For Tcl 9 a better
	solution is needed, but that cannot be done without introducing
	binary incompatibility.

2013-04-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/platform/platform.tcl (::platform::LibcVersion):
	* library/platform/pkgIndex.tcl: Followup to the 2013-01-30
	  change. The RE become too restrictive again. SuSe added a
	  timestamp after the version. Loosened up a bit. Bumped package
	  to version 1.0.12.

2013-04-25  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c:		Update dde to version 1.3.3.
	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* win/tclWinReg.c:		Update registry to version 1.2.2.
	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl:

2013-04-18  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclDecls.h: Implement Tcl_Pkg* functions as
	(faster/stack-saving) macros around Tcl_Pkg*Ex functions.
	The same for many Tcl_*Var* functions around their
	Tcl_*Var*2 equivalent and Tcl_GetIndexFromObj around
	Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct.

2013-04-09  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::geturl): Allow URLs that don't have
	a path, but a query query, e.g. http://example.com?foo=bar .
	* Bump the http package to 2.5.8.

2013-04-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/regc_color.c:	[Bug 3610026] Stop crash when the number of
	* generic/regerrs.h:	"colors" in a regular expression overflows
	* generic/regex.h:	a short int.  Thanks to Heikki Linnakangas
	* generic/regguts.h:	for the report and the patch.
	* tests/regexp.test:

2013-03-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFCmd.c: [Bug 3597000] Consistent [file copy] result.

2013-03-19  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: [Bug 2893771]: file stat fails on locked files
	on win32.

2013-03-18  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* tests/cmdAH.test (cmdAH-19.12): [Bug 3608360]: Added test to ensure
	that we never ever allow [file exists] to do globbing.

2013-03-12  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: Patch by Andrew Shadura, providing better support for
	three architectures they have in Debian.

2013-03-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/regc_nfa.c:	[Bugs 3604074,3606683] Rewrite of the
	* generic/regcomp.c:	fixempties() routine (and supporting
	routines) to completely eliminate the infinite loop hazard.
	Thanks to Tom Lane for the much improved solution.

2013-03-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtil.c:	New scheme for keeping the per-process
	tcl_precision value in sync without the need for mutex locks on
	every read.  Uses adapted ProcessGlobalValue machinery backported
	from Tcl 8.5 where it's been working without reported problems.
	Thanks to Phil Brooks for reporting on tests which highlight the
	thread performance problems raised by the old scheme, and to Clif
	Flynt for further testing pointing the finger at tcl_precision
	locks as the main culprit.

2013-02-27  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/regcomp.c:	[Bug 3606139]: missing error check allows
	* tests/regexp.test:    regexp to crash Tcl. Thanks to Tom Lane
	for providing the test-case and the patch.

2013-02-22  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:	Shift more burden of smart cleanup onto the
	* generic/tclExecute.c:	TclFreeCompileEnv() routine.  Stop crashes
	when the hookProc raises an error.

2013-02-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c:	[Bug 3605447] Make sure the -clear option
	* tests/namespace.test:	to [namespace export] always clears, whether
	or not new export patterns are specified.

2013-02-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/regc_nfa.c:	[Bug 3604074] Fix regexp optimization to
	* tests/regexp.test:	stop hanging on the expression
	((((((((a)*)*)*)*)*)*)*)* .  Thanks to Bj√∏rn Grathwohl for discovery.

2013-02-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c:	[Bug 3603434] Make sure TclpObjNormalizePath() 
	properly declares "a:/" to be normalized, even when no "A:" drive is
	present on the system.

2013-01-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/platform/platform.tcl (::platform::LibcVersion): See
	* library/platform/pkgIndex.tcl: [Bug 3599098]: Fixed the RE
	  extracting the version to avoid issues with recent changes to
	  the glibc banner. Now targeting a less variable part of the
	  string. Bumped package to version 1.0.11.

2013-01-26  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixCompat.c: [Bug 3601804]: platformCPUID segmentation
	fault on Darwin.

2013-01-16  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* Makefile.in: Enable win32 build with -DTCL_NO_DEPRECATED, just
	* generic/tcl.h: as the UNIX build. Define Tcl_EvalObj and
	* generic/tclDecls.h: Tcl_GlobalEvalObj as macros, even when
	* generic/tclBasic.c: TCL_NO_DEPRECATED is defined, so Tk
	can benefit from it too.

2013-01-08  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: [Bug 3092089]: [file normalize] can remove path
	components.	[Bug 3587096] win vista/7: "can't find init.tcl" when
	called via junction.

2013-01-07  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls: Extend the public and private stub tables with
	* generic/tclInt.decls: dummy NULL entries, up to the size of the
	Tcl 8.6 stub tables. This makes it easier to debug extensions which
	use Tcl 8.5/8.6 features but (erroneously) are attempted to be loaded
	in Tcl 8.4.

2012-12-31  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/string.n: Noted the obsolescence of the 'bytelength',
	'wordstart' and 'wordend' subcommands, and moved them to later in the
	file.

2012-12-27  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclListObj.c: [Bug 3598580]: Tcl_ListObjReplace may release
	deleted elements too early

2012-12-21  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/dltest/pkgb.c:  Turn pkgb.so into a Tcl9 interoperability test
    library: Whatever Tcl9 looks like, loading pkgb.so in Tcl 9 should
    either result in an error-message, either succeed, but never crash.
	* generic/tclStubLib.c: Eliminate unnessarcy static HasStubSupport() and
	isDigit() functions, just do the same inline.

2012-12-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Fix Tcl_DecrRefCount macro such that it
	doesn't access its objPtr parameter twice any more.

2012-11-14  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (DefaultTempDir): [Bug 2933003]: Allow overriding
	of the back-stop default temporary file location at compile time by
	setting the TCL_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY #def to a string containing
	the directory name (defaults to "/tmp" as that is the most common
	default).

2012-11-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinSock.c:	[Bug 3574493] Avoid hanging on exit due to
	use of synchronization calls in routines called by DllMain().

2012-10-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c:	When checking for std channels being closed,
	compare the channel state, not the channel itself so that stacked
	channels do not cause trouble.

2012-08-17  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/nmakehlp.c: Add "-V<num>" option, in order to be able
	to detect partial version numbers.

2012-07-31  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/nmakehlp.c: Backport from Tcl 8.6, but add -Q option from
	sampleextension.

2012-07-27  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclUniData.c:   Support Unicode 6.2 (Add Turkish lira sign)
	* generic/regc_locale.c:

2012-07-17  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/makefile.vc: [Bug 3544932]: Visual studio compiler check fails

2012-07-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c:	[Bug 1189293] Make "<<" binary safe.
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:

2012-06-29  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:   Add tn, ro_MO and ru_MO to msgcat. Make it
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl: work on cygwin. Bump to 1.3.5

2012-06-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/GetIndex.3: Reinforced the description of the requirement for
	the tables of names to index over to be static, following posting to
	tcl-core by Brian Griffin about a bug caused by Tktreectrl not obeying
	this rule correctly. This does not represent a functionality change,
	merely a clearer documentation of a long-standing constraint.

2012-06-23  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: [Bug 3508771]: Cygwin notifier for handling
	win32 events.

2012-06-19  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinReg.c:  Plug memory leak, part of [Bug #3362446]

2012-06-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure.in:	Update autogoo for gettimeofday().
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:	Thanks Joe English.
	* unix/configure:	autoconf 2.13

2012-06-06  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: On Cygwin, use win32 API in stead of uname()
	to determine the tcl_platform variables.

2012-05-25  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c:    [Bug 473946]: special characters not correctly sent,
	now for XTYP_EXECUTE as well as XTYP_REQUEST.
	* win/Makefile.in:    Fix "make genstubs" when cross-compiling on UNIX

2012-05-24  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:  Take cygwin handling of X11 into account.
	* generic/tcl*Decls.h: re-generated
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:  Implement TclpIsAtty, Cygwin only.
	* doc/dde.n: Doc fix: "dde execute iexplore" doesn't work
	without -async, because iexplore doesn't return a value

2012-05-22  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:   Let cygwin share stub table with win32
	* win/Makefile.in:      Don't hardcode dde and reg dll version numbers
	* win/tclWinSock.c:     implement TclpInetNtoa for win32
	* generic/tclInt.decls: Revert most of [ae92de6078], since when
	  we let cygwin share the win32 stub table this is no longer necessary
	* generic/tcl*Decls.h:  re-generated

2012-05-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: When using Tcl_SetObjLength() calls to grow
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:	 and shrink the objPtr->bytes buffer, care must
	be taken that the value cannot possibly become pure Unicode.  Calling
	Tcl_AppendToObj() has the possibility of making such a conversion.  Bug
	found while valgrinding the trunk.

2012-05-17  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/expr.n: [Bug 3525462]: Corrected statement about what happens
	when comparing "0y" and "0x12"; the previously documented behavior was
	actually a subtle bug (now long-corrected).

2012-05-13  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c:   Protect against receiving strings without ending \0,
	as external applications (or Tcl with TIP #106) could generate that.

2012-05-10  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c:    [Bug 473946]: special characters not correctly sent
	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl  Increase version to 1.2.5

2012-05-02  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/configure.in:    Better detection and implementation for cpuid
	* generic/configure:       instruction on Intel-derived processors, both
	* generic/tclUnixCompat.c: 32-bit and 64-bit.
	* generic/tclTest.c:       Move cpuid testcase from win-specific to generic
	* win/tclWinTest.c:        tests, as it should work on all Intel-related
	* tests/platform.test:     platforms now
	* generic/tcl.decls:       Simplify stub tables for functions which work on
	* generic/tclInt.decls:    both UNIX and windows, as in Tcl 8.5 and 8.6
	* generic/tcl*Decls.h:

2012-04-27  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* library/init.tcl (auto_execok): Allow shell builtins to be detected
	even if they are upper-cased.

2012-04-24  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:      [Bug 3508771] load tclreg.dll in cygwin tclsh

	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tclUnixCompat.c:

2012-04-16  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3 (Tcl_FSOpenFileChannelProc): [Bug 3518244]: Fixed
	documentation of this filesystem callback function; it must not
	register its created channel - that's the responsibility of the caller
	of Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel - as that leads to reference leaks.

2012-04-11  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* win/tclWinInit.c:     [Bug 3448512]: clock scan "1958-01-01" fails only
	* win/tcl.m4:           in debug compilation.
	* win/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4:          Use NDEBUG consistantly meaning: no debugging.

	* generic/ttclStubInit.c:

2012-04-03  Jan Nijtmans  <nijtmans@users.sf.net>

	* tools/genStubs.tcl:        Let genStubs.tcl do the void -> VOID and
	const -> CONST translations, so we cannot forget it in the *.decls file
	* generic/tcl.decls:         VOID -> void and CONST -> const, so depend
	* generic/tclInt.decls:      on genStubs.tcl to generate the correct form
	form in the *Decls.h file. This brings tclInt.decls in the same form as
	Tcl 8.5/8.6, so a diff can show us the real signature differences.
	(Backported from Tcl 8.5, no change in any function signature)
	* generic/tclStubInit.c      Remove the TclpGetTZName implementation for
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:     Cygwin (from previous commit) , re-generated

2009-09-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj):	Pass 'length' values to

	counting lines for #280, during direct and compiled execution.

2009-08-17  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: Correct result from [glob */test] when *

2009-07-23  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* generic/tclNotify.c: Fix for [Bug 2820349].

	* generic/tclBasic.c (DeleteInterpProc,TclArgumentBCEnter,

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode):
	* generic/tclInt.h (ExtIndex, CFWordBC):
	* tests/info.test (info-39.0):

	Backport of some changes made to the Tcl head, to handle literal
	sharing better. The code here is much simpler (trimmed down)
	compared to the head as the 8.4 branch is not bytecode compiling
	whole files, and doesn't compile eval'd code either.

	Reworked the handling of literal command arguments in bytecode to
	be saved (compiler) and used (execution) per command (See the
	TCL_INVOKE_STK* instructions), and not per the whole bytecode.
	This removes the problems with location data caused by literal
	sharing in proc bodies. Simplified the associated datastructures
	(ExtIndex is gone, as is the function EnterCmdWordIndex).

2009-06-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c: The value stashed in iPtr->compiledProcPtr
	* generic/tclProc.c:    when compiling a proc survives too long.  We
	* tests/execute.test:   only need it there long enough for the right
	TclInitCompileEnv() call to re-stash it into envPtr->procPtr.  Once
	that is done, the CompileEnv controls.  If we let the value of
	iPtr->compiledProcPtr linger, though, then any other bytecode compile
	operation that takes place will also have its CompileEnv initialized
	with it, and that's not correct.  The value is meant to control the
	compile of the proc body only, not other compile tasks that happen
	along.  Thanks to Carlos Tasada for discovering and reporting the
	problem.  [Bug 2802881].

2009-04-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/configure (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): harden the check
	to add _r to CC on AIX with threads.

2009-04-27  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:   Backport fix for [Bug 1028264]: WSACleanup() too
	* generic/tclEvent.c: early. The fix introduces "late exit handlers"
	* win/tclWinSock.c:   for similar late process-wide cleanups.

2009-04-27  Alexandre Ferrieux  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Backport fix for [Bug 2446662]: resync Win
	behavior on RST with that of unix (EOF).

2009-04-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (UpdateStringOfString): Added cast to fix
	signed/unsigned mismatch breaking win32 symbol/debug build.

2009-04-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:       AppendUnicodeToUnicodeRep failed

2009-04-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:       Completed backports of fixes for
	[Bug 2494093] and [Bug 2553906].

2009-03-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Alloc.3:	Size argument is "unsigned int".  [Bug 2556263]

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:       Added protections from invalid memory
	* generic/tclTestObj.c:         accesses when we append (some part of)
	* tests/stringObj.test:         a Tcl_Obj to itself.  Added the
	appendself and appendself2 subcommands to the [teststringobj] testing
	command and added tests to the test suite.  [Bug 2603158]

2009-03-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileName.test:	Tests for [Bug 2710920] to guard against
	its appearance.

2009-03-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c:	Test stringObj-6.9 checks that
	* tests/stringObj.test:		Tcl_AppendStringsToObj() no longer
	crashes when operating on a pure unicode value.  [Bug 2597185]

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_CONCAT1):	Panic when appends overflow
	the max length of a Tcl value.  [Bug 2669109]

2009-03-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpObjNormalizePath):      Corrected Tcl_Obj leak.
	Thanks to Joe Mistachkin for detection and patch.  [Bug 2688184].

2009-02-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPathObj.c: Fixed mistaken logic in TclFSGetPathType()
	* tests/fileName.test:  that assumed (not "absolute" => "relative").
	This is a false assumption on Windows, where "volumerelative" is
	another possibility.  [Bug 2571597].

2008-02-06  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h (Darwin): workaround conflict between deprecated tcl
	panic macro and panic() function declaration in <mach/mach.h> header.

2009-02-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c: Added overflow protections to the
	AppendUtfToUtfRep routine to either avoid invalid arguments and
	crashes, or to replace them with controlled panics.  [Bug 2561794]

2009-02-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (SetUnicodeObj):       Corrected failure of
	Tcl_SetUnicodeObj() to panic on a shared object.  [Bug 2561488].  Also
	factored out common code to reduce duplication.

2009-01-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (STRING_SIZE): Corrected failure to limit
	memory allocation requests to the sizes that can be supported by
	Tcl's memory allocation routines.  [Bug 2494093].

2009-01-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (STRING_UALLOC):  Added missing parens
	required to get correct results out of things like
	STRING_UALLOC(num + append).  [Bug 2494093].

2008-12-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath):	Added another
	flag value TCLPATH_NEEDNORM to mark those intreps which need more
	complete normalization attention for correct results.  [Bug 2385549]

2008-12-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (TclDoGlob):	One of the
	Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory() calls did not have its return code
	checked.  Some VFS drivers can return TCL_ERROR, and when that's
	not checked, the error message gets converted into a list of
	matching files returned by [glob], with ridiculous results.

2008-12-01  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (TclFinalizeIOSubsystem): Revised latest commit to
	something that doesn't crash the test suite.

2008-11-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (TclFinalizeIOSubsystem): Applied backport of
	  Alexandre Ferrieux's patch for [Bug 2270477] to prevent infinite
	  looping during finalization of channels not bound to
	  interpreters.

2008-11-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Backport of fix for [Bug 2333466].

2008-11-04  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclPort.h: remove the ../{win,unix}/ header dirs as the
	build system already has it, and it confuses builds when used with
	private headers installed.

2008-09-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/global.n:	Correct false claim about [info locals].

2008-08-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileName.test:	Revise new tests for portability to case
	insensitive filesystems.

2008-08-14  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h:		add support for debug logging of DTrace
	* generic/tclBasic.c:		'proc', 'cmd' and 'inst' probes (does
					_not_ require a platform with DTrace).

	* unix/Makefile.in:		ensure Makefile shell is /bin/bash for
	* unix/configure.in (SunOS):	DTrace-enabled build on Solaris.
					(followup to 2008-06-12) [Bug 2016584]

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_X):	check for libX11.dylib in addition to
					libX11.so et al.

	* unix/configure: 		autoconf-2.13

2008-08-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:	Fix for errors handling -types {}
	* tests/fileName.test:		option to [glob]. [Bug 1750300]
	Thanks to Matthias Kraft and George Peter Staplin.

2008-08-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclProc.c (Tcl_ProcObjCmd): Fixed memory leak triggered
	* tests/proc.test: by procbody::test::proc. See [Bug 2043636].
	Added a test case demonstrating the leak before the fix. Fixed a
	few spelling errors in test descriptions as well.

2008-07-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Added missing release of extended command
	word index when deleting an interpreter (DeleteInterpProc). Added
	missing ref count when creating an empty string as path (EvalEx).

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclInitCompileEnv): Made same change to
	control flow as in TclEvalObjEx. Not needed while uplevel and
	siblings go through the eval-direct code path, however if that
	changes (like it did in 8.5+) better to have this in place instead
	of re-searching why certain places are without absolute locations.

	* tests/info.test: Added tests 38.*, exactly testing the tracking
	of location for uplevel scripts, and made the testsuite fully
	usable with and without -singleproc 1.

2008-07-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/info.test: Add !singleTestInterp constraint to various tests;
	(info-22.8, info-23.0): switch to glob matching to avoid sensitivity
	to tcltest.tcl line number changes. [Bug 1605269]

2008-07-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/info.test: Tests 38.* added, exactly testing the tracking
	of location for uplevel scripts.

2008-07-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Modified TclArgumentGet to reject pure lists
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: immediately, without search. Reworked setup
	* generic/tclCompile.c: of eoFramePtr, doesn't need the line
	* tests/info.test: information, more sensible to have everything
	on line 1 when eval'ing a pure list. Updated the users of the line
	information to special case this based on the frame type (i.e.
	TCL_LOCATION_EVAL_LIST). Added a testcase demonstrating the new
	behaviour.

2008-07-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Added missing function comments.

	* generic/tclCompile.c: Made the new TclEnterCmdWordIndex
	* generic/tclCompile.h: static.

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Reworked the handling of bytecode literals
	* generic/tclCompile.c: for #280 to fix the abysmal performance
	* generic/tclCompile.h: for deep recursion, replaced the linear
	* generic/tclExecute.c: search through the whole stack with
	* generic/tclInt.h: another hashtable and simplified the data
	structure used by the compiler (array instead of hashtable).
	Incidentially this also fixes the memory leak reported via [Bug
	2024937].

2008-07-21  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Extended the existing TIP #280 system (info
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: frame), added the ability to track the
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: absolute location of literal procedure
	* generic/tclCompile.c: arguments, and making this information
	* generic/tclCompile.h: available to uplevel, eval, and
	* generic/tclInterp.c: siblings. This allows proper tracking of
	* generic/tclInt.h: absolute location through custom (Tcl-coded)
	* generic/tclNamesp.c: control structures based on uplevel, etc.
	* generic/tclProc.c:

2008-07-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoFrameCmd): Fixed unsafe idiom of setting
	the interp result found by Don Porter.

2008-07-04  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c(UtfToUtfProc): Avoid unwanted sign extension
	when converting incomplete UTF-8 sequences. See [Bug 1908443] for
	details.

2008-07-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl:	Removed [file readable] testing from
	[tclPkgUnknown] and friends.  We find out soon enough whether a
	file is readable when we try to [source] it, and not testing
	before allows us to workaround the bugs on some common filesystems
	where [file readable] lies to us.  [Patch 1969717]

2008-06-28  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:	Plug memory leak in latest commit.  Thanks
	Rolf Ade for detecting and Dan Steffen for the fix [Bug 2004654].

2008-06-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: Fixed bug in Tcl_GetTranslatedPath() when
	operating on the "Special path" variant of the "path" Tcl_ObjType
	intrep.  A full normalization was getting done, in particular, coercing
	relative paths to absolute, contrary to what the function of
	producing the "translated path" is supposed to do.  [Bug 1972879].

2008-06-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/binary.test:	Corrected flawed tests revealed by a -debug 1
	* tests/io.test:	-singleproc 1 test suite run.

2008-06-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParseExpr.c:	Disabled attempts to support [expr]
	functions named eq(...) or ne(...).  Any attempts to use such
	functions were panicking.  [Bug 1971879].

2008-06-16  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoFrameCmd): Backport of fix made on the
	* tests/info.test: head branch :: Moved the code looking up the
	information for key 'proc' out of the TCL_LOCATION_BC branch to
	after the switch, this is common to all frame types. Updated the
	testsuite to match. This was exposed by the 2008-06-08 commit
	(Miguel), switching uplevel from direct eval to compilation. Fixes
	[Bug 1987851].

2008-06-12  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoFrameCmd): TIP #280 conditional
	  feature. Added checks to validate HashEntry and HashTable
	  information gotten from Command structures. This seems to be
	  needed to handle structures managed by Itcl.

2008-06-12  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:		add complete deps on tclDTrace.h.

	* unix/Makefile.in:		clean generated tclDTrace.h file.
	* unix/configure.in (SunOS): 	fix static DTrace-enabled build.

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SunOS-5.11): fix 64bit amd64 support with gcc & Sun cc.
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2008-05-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/io.test (io-53.9): need to close chan before removing file.

2008-05-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c (FileWideSeekProc): Accepted a patch by
	  Alexandre Ferrieux <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net> to fix the
	  [Bug 1965787]. 'tell' now works for locations > 2 GB as well
	  instead of going negative.

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize): Accepted a patch by
	* tests/io.test:  Alexandre Ferrieux <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>
	  to fix the [Bug 1969953]. Buffersize outside of the supported
	  range are now clipped to nearest boundary instead of ignored.

2008-04-26  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclAsync.c: Tcl_AsyncDelete(): panic if attempt
	to locate handler token fails. Happens when some other
	thread attempts to delete somebody else's token.

	Also, panic early if we find out the wrong thread attempting
	to delete the async handler (common trap). As, only the one
	that created the handler is allowed to delete it.

2008-04-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	*** 8.4.19 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (CompileMathFuncCall): Added
	* tests/compExpr.test (compExpr-5.10): Tcl_ResetResult before
	appending error message, to clear out possible sharing. Added test
	case demonstrating the crash (abort on shared object) without the
	fix.

2008-04-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData): Applied another patch by Alexandre
	* io.test (io-53.8a): Ferrieux <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>,
	to shift EOF handling to the async part of the command if a
	callback is specified, should the channel be at EOF already when
	fcopy is called. Testcase by myself.

2008-04-14  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c (TclpGetClicks, Tcl_GetTime): Removed
	obsolete use of 'struct timezone' in the call to 'gettimeofday'.
	[Bug 1942197].

2008-04-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:	Plug memory leak introduced in the
	2008-03-07 commit.  [Bug 1940433]

2008-04-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README:		Bump version number to 8.4.19

	* changes:		updates for 8.4.19 release.

2008-04-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_FcopyObjCmd): Keeping check for negative
	values, changed to not be an error, but behave like the special
	value -1 (copy all, default).

	* tests/iocmd.test (iocmd-15.{12,13}): Removed.

	* tests/io.test (io-52.5{,a,b}): Reverted last change, added
	comment regarding the meaning of -1, added two more testcases for
	other negative values, and input wrapped to negative.

2008-04-09  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/io.test (io-52.5): Removed '-size -1' from test, does not
	seem to have any bearing, and was an illegal value. Test case is
	not affected by the value of -size, test flag restoration and that
	everything was properly copied.

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_FcopyObjCmd): Added checking of -size
	* tests/ioCmd.test (iocmd-15.{13,14}): value to reject negative
	values, and values overflowing 32-bit signed. [Bug 1557855]. Basic
	patch by Alexandre Ferrieux <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>, with
	modifications from me to separate overflow from true negative
	value. Extended testsuite.

2008-04-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/io.test (io-53.8,53.9,53.10): Backported das' fix of typo
	  and quoting for spaces in builddir path.

2008-04-07  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/io.test (io-53.10): Testcase for bi-directionaly fcopy.
	* generic/tclIO.c: Additional changes to data structures for fcopy
	* generic/tclIO.h: and channels to perform proper cleanup in case
	  of a channel having two background copy operations running as is
	  now possible.

	* generic/tclIO.c (BUSY_STATE, CheckChannelErrors,
	  TclCopyChannel): New macro, and the places using it. This change
	  allows for bi-directional fcopy on channels. [Bug 1350564].
	  Thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net>
	  for the patch.

	* tests/io.test (io-53.9): Made test cleanup robust against the
	  possibility of slow process shutdown on Windows. Backported from
	  Kevin Kenny's change to the same test on the 8.5 and head
	  branches.

2008-04-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/io.test (io-53.9): Added testcase for [Bug 780533], based
	  on Alexandre's test script. Also fixed problem with timer in
	  preceding test, was not canceled properly in the ok case.

2008-04-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData): Applied patch [Bug 1932639] to
	* tests/io.test: prevent fcopy from calling -command synchronously
	  the first time. Thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux
	  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net> for report and patch.

2008-04-02  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (CopyData): Applied patch for the fcopy problem
	  [Bug 780533], with many thanks to Alexandre Ferrieux
	  <ferrieux@users.sourceforge.net> for tracking it down and
	  providing a solution. Still have to convert his test script into
	  a proper test case.

	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): --enable-64bit: verify linking with 64bit -arch
	flag succeeds before enabling 64bit build.
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2006-12-14  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/string.n: Fix example. [Bug 1615277]

2006-12-05  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/pkg.test:   Backport to 8.4 (Don Porter's work):
	* generic/tclPkg.c: When no requirements are supplied to a [package
	require $pkg] and [package unknown] is invoked to find a satisfying
	package, pass the requirement argument "0-" (which means all versions
	are acceptable). This permits a registered [package unknown] command
	to call [package vsatisfies $testVersion {*}$args] without any special
	handling of the empty $args case. This fixes/avoids a bug in
	[::tcl::tm::UnknownHandler] that was causing old TM versions to be
	provided in preference to newer TM versions. Thanks to Julian Noble
	for discovering the issue.

2006-12-04  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TclUnixWaitForFile):
	* tests/event.test (event-14.*): Corrected a bug where

	the presence of execution traces that delete it.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TEOVI):

	* win/tclWinTime.c:

2006-09-26  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	As 2006-09-22 commit from Donal K. Fellows
	demonstrates, "#define NULL 0" is just wrong, and as a quotable chat
	figure observed, "If NULL isn't defined, we're not using a C compiler."
	Improper fallback definition of NULL removed.

2006-09-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_StackChannel): Fixed [SF Tcl Bug 1564642], aka

	prevent seg.fault.

2006-09-25  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Reverted exposure of patchlevel in registered
	core version when TIP#268 features are activated. Better compatibility
	with existing packages. Like Tk.

2006-09-24  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_ParseCommand): also return an error if
	start==NULL and numBytes<0. This is coverity's bug #20

	of the structure, for better backward compatibility.

2006-09-22  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclPkg.c (Tcl_PkgRequireEx): Changes handling of the return

	More details in the comments.

2006-09-22  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclThreadTest.c (TclCreateThread): Use NULL instead of 0 as
	end-of-strings marker to Tcl_AppendResult; the difference matters on
	64-bit machines. [Bug 1562528]

2006-09-21  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tcl.decls:  Implemented TIP #268, conditionally.

	gethost functions.
	* unix/configure: Regenerated, using autoconf 2.13

	* unix/tclUnixCompat.c (PadBuffer): Fixed bug in calculation of the

2006-09-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/msgcat.test: Bumped version in auxiliary files as well.

	needed; adjust #ifdefs to cover all possible cases; fix whitespace.

2006-09-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:	Bump to version msgcat 1.3.4 to account
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:	for modifications.

2006-09-10  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl (msgcat::Init): on Darwin, add fallback of
	* tests/msgcat.test:			    default msgcat locale to
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetVariables):    current CFLocale
	identifier if available (via private ::tcl::mac::locale global, set at
	interp init when on Mac OS X 10.3 or later with CoreFoundation).

	* unix/tcl.m4: add caching to new SC_TCL_* macros for MT-safe wrappers
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2006-09-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixCompat.c: Fixed conditions for CopyArray/CopyString, and
	CopyHostent. Also fixed bad var names in TclpGetHostByName.

2006-09-08  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixCompat.c: Added fallback to gethostbyname() and
	gethostbyaddr() if the implementation is known to be MT-safe
	(currently for Darwin 6 or later only).

	* unix/configure.in: Assume gethostbyname() and gethostbyaddr() are
	MT-safe starting with Darwin 6 (Mac OSX 10.2).

	* unix/configure: Regenerated with autoconf V2.13

2006-09-07  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: Removed some false tests added (and left by
	mistake) by fixing [Bug 999544]

	* unix/tclUnixCompat.c: Added fallback to MT-unsafe library calls if
	TCL_THREADS is not defined. Fixed alignment of arrays copied by
	CopyArrayi() to be on the sizeof(char *) boundary.

2006-09-07  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/configure: Regenerated using autoconf 2.13.

2006-09-07  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c   Rewritten MT-safe wrappers to
	* unix/tclUnixCompat.c return ptrs to TSD storage
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c   making them all look like their
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h   MT-unsafe pendants API-wise.
	* unix/tclUnixSock.c

2006-09-06  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: Added TCL_THREADS ifdef'ed  usage
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: of MT-safe calls like:
	* unix/tclUnixSock.c: getpwuid, getpwnam, getgrgid, getgrnam,
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: gethostbyname and gethostbyaddr.
	* unix/Makefile.in:   See Tcl Bug: 999544
	* unix/configure.in:

	some library calls.

2006-09-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/main.text (Tcl_Main-4.4):	Test corrected to not be
	timing sensitive to the Bug 1481986 fix. [Bug 1550858]

2006-09-04  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/package.n: correct package example

2006-08-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinChan.c: [Bug 819667] Improve logic for identifying COM
	ports.

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:    [Bug 1548263] Added test for NULL return
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: from Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath which was
	causing segv's

	* generic/tclFileName.c (TclDoGlob): match incr with existing decr.

	* unix/Makefile.in: add valgrindshell target and update default
	VALGRINDARGS. User can override, or add to it with VALGRIND_OPTS env
	var.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateInterp): init iPtr->threadId

	* generic/tclIOGT.c (ExecuteCallback):
	* generic/tclPkg.c (Tcl_PkgRequireEx): replace Tcl_GlobalEval(Obj)
	with more efficient Tcl_Eval(Obj)Ex

2006-08-22  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_WaitForEvent): Fixed broken if syntax
	committed 2006-08-21 by Daniel. The broken syntax is visible to all
	unix platforms, but not on OSX for machines which HAVE_COREFOUNDATION.

2006-08-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:	Revisions to complete the thread finalization
	of the cwdPathPtr. [Bug 1536142]

2006-08-21  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c (Tcl_WaitForEvent): if the run loop is
	already running (e.g. if Tcl_WaitForEvent was called recursively),
	re-run it in a custom run loop mode containing only the source for the
	notifier thread, otherwise wakeups from other sources added to the
	common run loop modes might get lost; sync panic msg changes from
	HEAD.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_WaitForEvent): on 64-bit Darwin,
	pthread_cond_timedwait() appears to have a bug that causes it to wait
	forever when passed an absolute time which has already been exceeded
	by the system time; as a workaround, when given a very brief timeout,
	just do a poll on that platform. [Bug 1457797]

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h (Darwin): override potentially faulty configure
	detection of termios availability in all cases, since termios is known
	to be present on all Mac OS X releases since 10.0. [Bug 497147]

2006-08-18  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): add support for --enable-64bit on x86_64, for
	universal builds including x86_64, for 64-bit CoreFoundation on
	Leopard and for use of -mmacosx-version-min instead of
	MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET.
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

	* generic/tcl.h:      add fixes for building on Leopard and support
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: for 64-bit CoreFoundation on Leopard.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: on Darwin x86_64, disable use of vfork as it
	causes execve to fail intermittently. (rdar://4685553)

	* macosx/README: updates for x86_64 support and Xcode 2.4.

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TclUnixWaitForFile): with timeout < 0, if
	select() returns early (e.g. due to a signal), call it again instead
	of returning a timeout result. Fixes intermittent event-13.8 failures.

2006-08-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:	Replace buffer copy in for loop with
	call to memcpy(). Thanks to afredd. [Patch 1530262]

2006-08-03  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpCreateProcess): for USE_VFORK: ensure
	standard channels are initialized before vfork() so that the child
	doesn't potentially corrupt global state in the parent's address
	space.

2006-07-30  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/clock.test: Allowed UTC as a synonym for GMT in two tests that
	indirectly invoke 'strftime' with the result of 'gmtime' to fix a
	bogus test failure on FreeBSD systems. [Bug 1513489]

2006-07-30  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/AppInit.3: Fix typo [Bug 1496886]

2006-07-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c (Tcl_InitNotifier, Tcl_WaitForEvent):
	create notifier thread lazily upon first call to Tcl_WaitForEvent()
	rather than in Tcl_InitNotifier(). Allows calling exeve() in processes
	where the event loop has not yet been run (Darwin's execve() fails in
	processes with more than one thread), in particular allows embedders
	to call fork() followed by execve(), previously the pthread_atfork()
	child handler's call to Tcl_InitNotifier() would immediately recreate
	the notifier thread in the child after a fork.

	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c (Tcl_InitNotifier):	   add support for
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, CopyFileAtts): weakly importing
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings):	   symbols not
	available on OSX 10.2 or 10.3, enables binaires built on later OSX
	versions to run on earlier ones.
	* macosx/README: document how to enable weak-linking; cleanup.
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: add support for weak-linking; conditionalize
	AvailabilityMacros.h inclusion; only disable realpath on 10.2 or
	earlier when threads are enabled.
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c (TclpLoadMemoryGetBuffer): change runtime Darwin
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitPlatform):	release check to use
						       global initialized once
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, TclpObjNormalizePath): add runtime
	Darwin release check to determine if realpath is threadsafe.
	* unix/configure.in: add check on Darwin for compiler support of weak
	* unix/tcl.m4:	     import and for AvailabilityMacros.h header; move
	Darwin specific checks & defines that are only relevant to the tcl
	build out of tcl.m4; restrict framework option to Darwin; cleanup
	quoting.
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c (TclpLoadMemory):
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpCreateProcess): fix signed-with-unsigned
	comparison and other warnings from gcc4 -Wextra.

2006-07-13  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: Added the inclusion of <AvailabilityMacros.h>.
	The missing header caused the upcoming #if conditions to wrongly
	exclude realpath, causing file normalize to ignore symbolic links in
	the path.

2006-07-11  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclAsync.c: Made Tcl_AsyncDelete() more tolerant when called
	after all thread TSD has been garbage-collected.

2006-07-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_CreateChannel): allow Tcl std channel
	inheritance to be #defined out (default remains in).

2006-06-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:		changes to start prep for an 8.4.14 release.

2006-06-14  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h (Darwin): support for MAC_OS_X_VERSION_MAX_ALLOWED
	define from AvailabilityMacros.h: override configure detection and only
	use API available in the indicated OS version or earlier.

2006-06-14  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/regerror.c:	Enable building Tcl with Microsoft's latest
	* generic/tcl.h:	compiler offering (VS2005). We have to handle
	* generic/tclDate.c:	a number of oddities as they have deprecated
	* tests/env.test:	most of the standard C library and now
	* win/makefile.vc:	generate manifest files to be linked into the
	* win/nmakehlp.c:	binaries. [Bug 1424909]
	* win/rules.vc:
	* win/tclWinTime.c:

2006-06-13  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclLoadDl.c (TclpDlopen): Workaround for a compiler bug in Sun
	Forte 6. [Bug 1503729]

2006-06-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/GetStdChan.3:	Added recommendation that each call to
	Tcl_SetStdChannel() be accompanied by a call to Tcl_RegisterChannel().

2006-05-31  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NamespaceInscopeCmd): revert [Bug 1400572]
	fix of 2006-01-09 for [namespace inscope] as it seems to mess with
	itcl scope decoding. Leaving namespace-29.6 test failure until final
	cause it determined.

2006-05-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tcl.h (Tcl_DecrRefCount): use if/else construct to allow
	placement in unbraced outer if/else conditions. (jcw)

2006-05-27  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c: implemented pthread_atfork() handler that
	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin):	    recreates CoreFoundation state and notifier
	thread in the child after a fork(). Note that pthread_atfork() is
	available starting with Tiger only. Because vfork() is used by the core
	on Darwin, [exec]/[open] are not affected by this fix, only extensions
	or embedders that call fork() directly (such as TclX). However, this
	only makes fork() safe from corefoundation tcl with --disable-threads;
	as on all platforms, forked children may deadlock in threaded tcl due
	to the potential for stale locked mutexes in the child. [Patch 923072]
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.59

2006-05-24  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_SYSTEM): Fixed quoting of command script to
	awk; it was a rarely used branch, but it was wrong. [Bug 1494160]

2006-05-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (TclDoGlob):	Disabled the partial
	normalization done by the recursive glob routine, since changing the
	precise string of the pathname broke [glob] on some Tcl_Filesystems.
	[Bug 943995]

	* generic/tclProc.c (ProcCompileProc):	When a bump of the compile
	epoch forces the re-compile of a proc body, take care not to
	overwrite any Proc struct that may be referred to on the active
	call stack. This fixes [Bug 1482718]. Note that the fix will not be
	effective for code that calls the private routine TclProcCompileProc()
	directly.

2006-05-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main):		Corrected flaw that required
	* tests/main.test: (Tcl_Main-4.5):	processing of one interactive
	command before passing control to the loop routine registered with
	Tcl_SetMainLoop() [Bug 1481986]

2006-05-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:	updates for another RC.

2006-04-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclRegexp.c (FinalizeRegexp): full reset data to indicate
	readiness for reinitialization.

2006-04-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct):	It seems there
	* tests/indexObj.test:	are extensions that rely on the prior behavior
	* doc/GetIndex.3:	that the empty string cannot succeed as a
	unique prefix matcher, so I'm restoring Donal Fellows's solution.
	Added mention of this detail to the documentation. [Bug 1464039]

2006-04-06  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: removed TCL_IO_TRACK_OS_FOR_DRIVER_WITH_BAD_BLOCKING
	define on Darwin. [Bug 1457515]
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2006-04-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl:	Long overlooked bump to registry
	* win/tclWinReg.c:		package version 1.1.4 (should have
	been done for the Tcl 8.4.8 release!)

	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:	Long overlooked bump to dde package
	* win/tclWinDde.c:		version 1.2.4 (should have been done
	for the Tcl 8.4.8 release!)

2006-04-05  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct): Allow empty
	strings to be matched by the Tcl_GetIndexFromObj machinery, in the
	same manner as any other key. [Bug 1464039]

2006-04-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPkg.c:	Revised Bug 1162286 fix from 2005-11-08 to be
	* tests/pkg.test:	even more forgiving of package version
	mismatch errors in [package ifneeded] commands, not even logging any
	warning messages. This further reduces the
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** noted for that change.

2006-04-03  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (ReadChars): Added check, panic and commentary to a
	piece of code which relies on BUFFER_PADDING to create enough space at
	the beginning of each buffer for the insertion of partial multibyte
	data at the beginning of a buffer. Commentary explains why this code
	is OK, and the panic is as a precaution if someone twiddled the
	BUFFER_PADDING into uselessness.

	* generic/tclIO.c (ReadChars): Temporarily suppress the use of
	TCL_ENCODING_END set when EOF was reached while the buffer we are
	converting is not truly the last buffer in the queue. Together with
	the Utf bug below it was possible to completely wreck the buffer data
	structures, eventually crashing Tcl. [Bug 1462248]

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (UtfToUtfProc): Stop accessing memory beyond
	the end of the input buffer when TCL_ENCODING_END is set and the last
	bytes of the buffer start a multi-byte sequence. This bug contributed
	to [Bug 1462248].

2006-03-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure, win/tcl.m4: define MACHINE for gcc builds as well.
	Needed by Tk for manifest generation.

	* win/tclWinConsole.c: revert 2005-11-03 [Patch 1256872] change to add
	win32 unicode console support as it broke the ability to modify the
	encoding to the console.

2006-03-28  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (TclpObjNormalizePath): deal with *BSD/Darwin
	realpath() converting relative paths into absolute paths. [Bug 1064247]

2006-03-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to nativeFilesystemRecord comparisons
	(lesser part of [Bug 1064247])

2006-03-27  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinTest.c:	Fixes for [Bug 1456373] (mingw-gcc issue)

2006-03-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinTest.c:
	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* tests/winFCmd.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test: Backport of [file writable] fixes for Windows
	from HEAD. [Bug 1193497]

2006-03-16  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/open.n: Documented the changed behaviour of 'a'ppend mode.

	* tests/io.test (io-43.1 io-44.[1234]): Rewritten to be
	self-contained with regard to setup and cleanup. [Bug 681793]

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (TclGetOpenMode): Added the flag O_APPEND to the
	list of POSIX modes used when opening a file for 'a'ppend. This
	enables the proper automatic seek-to-end-on-write by the OS. See [Bug
	680143] for longer discussion.

	* tests/ioCmd.test (iocmd-13.7.*): Extended the testsuite to check the
	new handling of 'a'.

2006-03-15  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/socket.test: Extended the timeout in socket-11.11 from 10 to
	40 seconds to allow for really slow machines. Also extended
	actual/expected results with value of variable 'done' to make it
	clearer when a test fails due to a timeout. [Bug 792159]

2006-03-14  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclPipe.c (TclCreatePipeline): Modified the processing of
	pipebars to fail if the last bar is followed only by redirections.
	[Bug 768659]

2006-03-14  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* doc/fconfigure.n: Clarified that -translation is binary is reported
	as lf when queried, because it is identical to lf, except for the
	special additional behaviour when setting it. [Bug 666770]

2006-03-14  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (Tcl_WaitPid): Backport of fix made to the head by
	David Gravereaux in 2004. See ChangeLog entry 2004-01-19. [Bug 1381436]

	Fixed a thread-safety problem with the process list. The delayed cut
	operation after the wait was going stale by being outside the list
	lock. It now cuts within the lock and does a locked splice for when it
	needs to instead. [Bug 859820]

2006-03-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:	Report error when an escape encoding
	is missing one of its sub-encodings [Bug 506653]

	* unix/configure.in:	Revert change from 2005-07-26 that sometimes
	* unix/configure:	added $prefix/share to the tcl_pkgPath.
	See [Patch 1231015]. autoconf-2.13.

2006-03-10  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	-- Summary of changes fixing [Bug 1437595] --

	* generic/tclEvent.c: Cosmetic touches and identation
	* generic/tclInt.h: Added TclpFinalizeSockets() call.

	* generic/tclIO.c: Calls TclpFinalizeSockets() as part of the
	TclFinalizeIOSubsystem().

	* unix/tclUnixSock: Added no-op TclpFinalizeSockets().

	* mac/tclMacSock.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c
	* win/tclWinSock.c: Finalization of the sockets/pipes is now solely
	done in TclpFinalizeSockets() and TclpFinalizePipes() and not over the
	thread-exit handler, because the order of actions the Tcl generic core
	will impose may result in cores/hangs if the thread exit handler tears
	down corresponding subsystem(s) too early.

2006-03-10  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: backported some fixes from HEAD relating to 'file

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Corrections to be sure that TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL
	* tests/parse.test:	evaluations act the same as [uplevel #0]

	to update the FP rounding mode on FreeBSD, taken from FreeBSD port.

2006-01-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_GetRange):
	* tests/stringTest (string-12.21):fixed incorrect handling of internal
	rep in Tcl_GetRange. Thanks to twylite and Peter Spjuth. [Bug 1410553]

	* generic/tclPipe.c (FileForRedirect): Prevent nameString from being
	freed without having been initialized.
	* tests/exec.test: Added a test for the above.

2006-01-12  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSGetInternalRep): fixed potential
	overwriting of already freed memory which caused all kinds of (rare
	but reproducible) coredumps all over the place.

2006-01-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/error.test (error-7.0):	Test the timing of write traces on
	::errorInfo. [Bug 1397843]

2006-01-10  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure:    add caching, use AC_CACHE_CHECK instead of

	* unix/tcl.m4:	     quoting, sync relevant tclconfig/tcl.m4 and HEAD
	changes and gratuitous formatting differences, fix SC_CONFIG_MANPAGES
	with default argument, Darwin improvements to SC_LOAD_*CONFIG.

2006-01-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (NamespaceInscopeCmd):	[namespace inscope]
	* tests/namespace.test:	commands were not reported by [info level].
	[Bug 1400572]

2005-12-20  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (Tcl_GetMemoryInfo): Format values as longs
	and not ints, so they are less likely to wrap on 64-bit machines.

2005-12-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/Tcl.n: Clarify what is going on in variable substitution
	following thread on comp.lang.tcl.

2005-12-14  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: workaround gcc warning "comparison is always
	* generic/tclTest.c:   false due to limited range of data type".

	* unix/configure.in: run check for fts API on all platforms, since
	Linux glibc2 and *BSDs also have this and using fts is more efficient
	than recursive opendir/readdir (sync with HEAD).
	* unix/configure: regen.

2005-12-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/configure: Fix sh quoting error reported in

	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprAbsFunc): fixed the abs(MIN_INT) case so
	that it doesn't break on compilers that don't assume integers to wrap
	around (e.g. gcc-4.1.0).

2005-12-09  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* tests/lsearch.test (lsearch-10.8..10): If the -start is off the end,
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsearchObjCmd): searching should find
	nothing at all. [Bug 1374778]

2005-11-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tcl.m4:	   Add build support for Windows-x64 builds.
	* win/configure:   --enable-64bit now accepts =amd64|ia64 for
	* win/Makefile.in: Windows 64-bit build variants (default: amd64)

	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_GetWideIntFromObj): Add more efficient
	conversion to wides from normal ints. [Bug 1310081]

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsearchObjCmd): Allow [lsearch -regexp] to
	process REs that contain backreferences. This expensive mode of
	operation is only used if the RE would otherwise cause a compilation
	failure. [Bug 1366683]

2005-11-28  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinSock.c (CreateSocket): Applied [Patch 1353853] to prevent
	reads of uninitialized variables during cleanup.

	(SC_ENABLE_LANGINFO, SC_TIME_HANDLER): add/fix caching, fix obsolete
	autoconf macros. Sync with tk/unix/tcl.m4, sync whitespace with HEAD.

	* unix/configure.in: fix obsolete autoconf macros, sync gratuitous
	formatting/ordering differences with tk/unix/configure.in.

	* unix/Makefile.in: add CFLAGS to tclsh/tcltest link to make
	executable linking the same as during configure (needed to avoid
	loosing any linker relevant flags in CFLAGS, in particular flags that
	can't be in LDFLAGS). Avoid concurrent linking of tclsh and compiling
	of tclTestInit.o or xtTestInit.o during parallel make.
	(checkstubs, checkdoc, checkexports): dependency and Darwin fixes

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c (TclpDlopen): [Bug 1204237] use
	NSADDIMAGE_OPTION_WITH_SEARCHING on second NSAddImage only.
	(TclGuessPackageName): should not be MODULE_SCOPE.
	(TclpLoadMemory): ppc64 and endian (i386) fixes, add support for
	loading universal (fat) bundles from memory.

	defines to support fat compiles of ppc and ppc64 at the same time,
	(replaces Darwin CVS fix by emoy, rdar://3693001).
	add/correct location of version numbers in macosx files.

	* generic/tclInt.h: clarify fat compile comment.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: add Darwin specifc configure overrides to
	support fat compiles, where configure runs only once for multiple
	architectures (replaces Darwin CVS fix by emoy, rdar://3693001).

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c:
	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c:
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: fix #include order to support compile time
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:  override of HAVE_COREFOUNDATION in
	tclUnixPort.h when building for ppc64

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/default.pbxuser (new file):
	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/jingham.pbxuser:
	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: sync with HEAD.

	* macosx/README: clarification/cleanup, sync with HEAD, document
	universal (fat) builds via CFLAGS (i.e. all of ppc ppc64 i386 at once).

	* macosx/Makefile: add support for reusing configure cache, build
	target fixes, remove GENERIC_FLAGS override now handled by tcl.m4.

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclRegexp.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c: declare globals used only in own file as static
	(sync with HEAD).

	* unix/configure: regen.

2005-11-20  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStubLib.c: Don't set tclStubsPtr to 0 when
	Tcl_PkgRequireEx() fails [Fix for [Bug 1091431] "Tcl_InitStubs failure
	crashes wish"]

2005-11-18  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/trace.test (trace-34.5): [Bug 1047286], added a second test
	illustrating the role of "ns in callStack" in the ns's visibility
	during deletion traces.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteCommandFromToken):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceCommandProc):
	* generic/tclInt.h (NS_KILLED):
	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_DeleteNamespace
	* tests/namespace.test (namespace-7.3-6):
	* tests/trace.test (trace-20.13-16): fix [Bugs 1355942/1355342].

2005-11-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (TclFinalizeIOSubsystem): preserve statePtr until we
	netrieve next statePtr from it.

2005-11-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclPkg.c:	Revised Bug 1162286 fix from 2005-11-08 to be
	* tests/pkg.test:	more forgiving of package version mismatch
	errors in [package ifneeded] commands. This reduces the
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** noted for that change.

2005-11-18  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (TclFinalizeIOSubsystem): Applied Pat Thoyts' patch
	for [Bug 1359094]. This moves the retrieval of the next channel state
	to the end of the loop, as the called closeproc may close other
	channels, i.e., modify the list we are iterating, invalidating any
	pointer retrieved earlier.

2005-11-18  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@manchester.ac.uk>

	* library/http/http.tcl (http::geturl): Improved syntactic validation
	of URLs, and better error messages in some cases. [Bug 1358369]

	* changes:		Update changes for 8.4.12 release

2005-11-15  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: Backported the fix for [Bug 926016] because of
	* win/tclWinFile.c: a repeated bug report in 8.4 [Bug 1353840].
	Windows [file mtime] will now return seconds from the Posix epoch
	correctly (except for FAT32 file systems after a DST change without a
	reboot - for which there is no help). A side effect is that file times
	will appear different in Tcl from the way they do in Windows Explorer
	or a 'dir' listing, because the Microsoft tools get the DST state
	wrong in the listings.

2005-11-09  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclTimer.c: Changed [after] so that it behaves correctly
	* tests/timer.test:   with negative arguments. [Bug 1350293]

2005-11-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (MAX_READDIR_UNLINK_THRESHOLD): reduce to 130
	based on errors seen on OS X 10.3 with lots of links in a dir. [Bug
	1034337 followup]

2005-11-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/expr.test:	Portable tests expr-46.13-18 [Bug 1341368]

	* generic/tclPkg.c:	Corrected inconsistencies in the value returned
	* tests/pkg.test:	by Tcl_PkgRequire(Ex) so that the returned
	values will always agree with what is stored in the package database.
	This way repeated calls to Tcl_PkgRequire(Ex) have the same results.
	Thanks to Hemang Lavana. [Bug 1162286]
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***: Incompatible with those existing
	packages that are accustomed to the [package] command forgiving
	their bugs.

	* tests/namespace.test (25.7,8):	Backport test of knownBug.

2005-11-08  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclTraceVariableObjCmd, TraceVarProc): Applied
	Miguel's fix for [Bug 1348775]. It is not quite as elegant as the one
	applied to the HEAD, but it is easier to use it rather than fully
	backporting.

2005-11-07  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/trace.test (trace-13.2-4): added tests to detect leak, see
	[Bug 1348775].

2005-11-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4:	Added code to enable [load] on LynxOS. Thanks to
	heidibr@users.sf.net for the patch. [Bug 1163896]

	* unix/configure:	autoconf-2.13.

2005-11-04  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: Applied [Patch 1267871] by Matt Newman which
	* win/tclWinPort.h: provides extended error code support.
	* tests/exec.test:  Wrote some tests for this feature.

2005-11-04  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclGetDate.y: Added abbreviations for the Korean timezone.
	* generic/tclDate.c:	Regenerated.

	* compat/strftime.c: Fixed a problem where the name of the time zone
	was double-converted from system encoding to UTF-8. Thanks to the
	anonymous submitter of [Bug 1317477] for the report and the patch.

2005-11-04  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c: fix for [Bugs 1338280/1337229]. Thanks Don.

	* tests/trace.test: fix duplicate test numbers

2005-11-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUnixInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings):	Modified so
	that multiple calls can continue to atttempt to properly set the
	system encoding. Needed for Tclkit to properly support non-default
	encodings. Thanks to Yaroslav Schekin. [Bug 1201171]

2005-11-03  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:   Backported Anton Kovalenko's [Patch 1256872]
	* win/tclWinConsole.c: to give unicode console support on
	* win/tclWinInt.h:     suitable systems (eg: NT/XP)

2005-11-01  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclCheckExecutionTraces):	Corrected mistaken
	assumption that all command traces are set at the script level.
	Report/fix from Jacques H. de Villiers. [Bug 1337941]

	* tests/expr-old.test (expr-32.52):	Use int(.) to restrict result
	of left shift to the C long range.

2005-10-29  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/expr.test: Fix problems in new round() tests that lead to
	correct result only on 32 bit long systems. [Bug 1341368]

2005-10-29  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceVarProc): [Bug 1337229], partial fix.
	Ensure that a second call with TCL_TRACE_DESTROYED does not lead to a
	second call to Tcl_EventuallyFree(). It is still true that that second
	call should not happen, so the bug is not completely fixed.
	* tests/trace.test (test-18.3-4): added tests for [Bugs 1337229 and
	1338280].

2005-10-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprRoundFunc): Fix typo where number before
	rounding is compared with smallest integer instead of number after
	rounding. This fix does not change the results of any tests.
	* tests/expr.test: Add round() tests for cases near the min and max
	int values.
	* tests/util.test: Remove pointless warning code about testobj command

	Tcl_SetVar2Ex, Tcl_ObjSetVar2 or Tcl_SetObjErrorCode with a 0-ref new
	value. It is not possible to handle error returns correctly in that
	case [Bug 1334947], one has the choice of leaking the object in some
	cases, or else risk crashing in some others.

2005-10-22  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_CONCAT): disable the optimisation for
	wide integers. [Bug 1251791]

2005-10-14  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ClearChannelHandlers): removed change dated
	2005-10-04 below. Look into [Bug 1323992] for detailed discussion.

2005-10-13  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Stop [format] from seeing
	the difference between ints and wides. [Bug 1284178]

2005-10-13  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ClearChannelHandlers): temporary
	ifdef TCL_THREADS changes done to de-activate pending
	event processing when channel is being closed/cutted.

2005-10-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (TraverseUnixTree): Adjust 2004-11-11 change to
	* tests/fCmd.test (fCmd-20.2):		 account for NFS special
	files with a readdir rewind threshold. [Bug 1034337]

2005-10-05  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclPipe.c (TclCreatePipeline): Fixed [Bug 1109294]. Applied
	the patch provided by David Gravereaux.

	* doc/CrtChannel.3: Fixed [Bug 1104682], by application of David
	Welton's patch for it, and added a note about wideSeekProc.

2005-10-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/env.test (env-6.1):
	* win/tclWinPort.h: define USE_PUTENV_FOR_UNSET 1
	* generic/tclEnv.c (TclSetEnv, TclUnsetEnv): add
	USE_PUTENV_FOR_UNSET to existing USE_PUTENV define to account for
	various systems that have putenv(), but can't unset env vars with it.
	Note difference between Windows and Linux for actually unsetting the
	env var (use of '=').
	Correct the resizing of the environ array. We assume that we are in
	full ownership, but that's not correct. [Bug 979640]

2005-10-04  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialSetOptionProc): free argv [Bug 1067708]

	* tests/http.test:		Do not URI encode -._~ according to
	* library/http/http.tcl (init): RFC3986. [Bug 1182373] (aho)

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (TclFSNormalizeAbsolutePath): make static
	* generic/tclEncoding.c (TclFindEncodings): make static

	* unix/tclLoadShl.c (TclpDlopen): use DYNAMIC_PATH on second
	shl_load only. [Bug 1204237]

2005-10-04  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_ClearChannelHandlers): now deletes any
	outstanding timer for the channel. Also, prevents events still
	in the event queue from triggering on the current channel.

	* generic/tclTimer.c (Tcl_DeleteTimerHandler): bail out early
	if passed NULL argument.

2005-09-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c:	Separate encoding conversion of command line
	arguments from list formatting. [Bug 1306162]

2005-09-27  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (FormatNumber): Factorize out copying of double
	values to a helper to work around ugly broken compiler problems. [Bug
	1116542]

2005-09-15  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/ParseCmd.3: copy/paste fix [Bug 1292427]

2005-09-15  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_TCL_EARLY_FLAGS): Added extra hack to allow Tcl to
	transparently open large files on RHEL 3. [Bug 1287638]

	* unix/configure:	autoconf-2.13

2005-09-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharToUtf):	Corrected handling of negative
	* tests/utf.test (utf-1.5):	Tcl_UniChar input value. Incorrect
	handling was producing byte sequences outside of Tcl's legal internal
	encoding. [Bug 1283976]

2005-08-29  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (ExprMathFunc): Restored "round away from zero"
	* tests/expr.test (expr-46.*):	     behaviour to the "round"
	function. Added test cases for the behavior, including the awkward
	case of a number whose fractional part is 1/2-1/2ulp. [Bug 1275043]

2005-08-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclListObj.c (UpdateStringOfList): Stop uncontrolled and
	unsafe crashes from happening when working with very large string
	representations. [Bug 1267380]

2005-08-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclFCmd.c (TclFileMakeDirsCmd): fix to race condition in
	file mkdir (backport from head 2005-06-13) [Bug 1217375]

2005-08-16  Kevin Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Pushed Tcl_FinalizeLoad and
	Tcl_ResetFilesystem down after Tcl_FinalizeThreadAlloc because
	unloading DLLs can't happen while they still own TSD keys.
	(This is a backport of changes made in the HEAD on 2005-08-10.)

2005-08-05  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (localeTable): Solaris uses a non-standard name
	for the cp1251 charset. Thanks to Victor Wagner for reporting this.
	[Bug 1252475]

2005-08-05  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Fixed a corner case
	* tests/expr.test (expr-38.1):		     where applying abs to
	MIN_INT failed to promote the result to a wide integer. [Bug 1241572]

2005-08-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c:	Simplified routines that manage the typeTable.

2005-08-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c:	Untangled some dependencies in the
	* generic/tclEvent.c:		order of finalization routines.

	* generic/tclObj.c:

2005-07-30  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure, unix/tcl.m4: revert 2005-07-28 change.

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c (TclpDlopen, TclpLoadMemory): workarounds for
	bugs/changes in behaviour in Mac OS X 10.4 Tiger, sync formatting
	changes from HEAD.

2005-07-29  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoGlobalsCmd): Even in high-speed mode, still
	have to take care with non-existant variables. [Bug 1247135]

2005-07-28  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update link to msys_mingw8.zip. Remove old Cygwin +
	Mingw info, people should just build with the msys + mingw
	configuration.

2005-07-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure, unix/tcl.m4: defined TCL_LOAD_FROM_MEMORY on Darwin
	only for SHARED_BUILD

2005-07-28  Donal K. Fellows  <dkf@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclPipe.c (TclCreatePipeline): Arrange for POSIX systems to
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclpOpenFile):	 use the O_APPEND flag for
	* tests/exec.test (exec-19.1):		 files opened in a pipeline
	like ">>this".	Note that Windows cannot support such access; there is
	no equivalent flag on the handle that can be set at the kernel-call
	level. The test is unix-specific in every way. [Bug 1245953]

2005-07-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Check for a $prefix/share directory and add it
	the the package if found. This will check for Tcl packages in
	/usr/local/share when Tcl is configured with the default dist install.
	[Patch 1231015]

2005-07-26  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tclvars.n:	Improved $errorCode documentation. [RFE 776921]

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CallWhenDeleted):	Converted to use
	per-thread counter, rather than a process global one that required
	mutex protection. [RFE 1077194]

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (TclTeardownNamespace):	Re-ordering so that
	* tests/trace.test (trace-34.4):	command delete traces fire
	while the command still exists. [Bug 1047286]

2005-07-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PROG_TCLSH, SC_BUILD_TCLSH):
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_PROG_TCLSH, SC_BUILD_TCLSH):
	Split confused search for tclsh on PATH and build and install
	locations into two macros. SC_PROG_TCLSH searches just the PATH.
	SC_BUILD_TCLSH determines the name of the tclsh executable in the Tcl
	build directory. [Bug 1160114], [Patch 1244153]

2005-07-22  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/auto.tcl:	Updates to the Tcl script library to make
	* library/history.tcl:	use of Tcl 8.4 feautures.  Thanks to
	* library/init.tcl:	Patrick Fradin for prompting on this.
	* library/package.tcl:	[Patch 1237755]
	* library/safe.tcl:
	* library/word.tcl:

2005-07-07  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/configure: Backported [Bug 1095909], removing
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:	       any use of readdir_r as it is not
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:	       necessary and just confuses things.

2005-07-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:	 New "encoding" Tcl_ObjType (not registered)
	* generic/tclEncoding.c: that permits longer lifetimes of the
	* generic/tclInt.h:	 Tcl_Encoding values kept as intreps of
	Tcl_Obj's.  Reduces the need for repeated reading of encoding
	definition files from the filesystem. [Bug 1077262]

	* generic/tclNamesp.c:	Allow for [namespace import] of a command
	* tests/namespace.test: over a previous [namespace import] of itself
	without throwing an error. [RFE 1230597]

2005-07-01  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: protect against spurious wake-ups while waiting
	on the condition variable when tearing down the notifier thread. [Bug
	1222872]

2005-06-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	*** 8.4.11 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* library/auto.tcl:	Reverted to Revision 1.12.2.3 (Tcl 8.4.9).
	Restores the (buggy) behavior of [auto_reset] that fails to clear
	away auto-loaded commands from non-global namespaces.  Fixing this
	bug exposed an unknown number of buggy files out there (including at
	least portions of the Tk script library) that cannot tolerate double
	[source]-ing.  The burden of fixing these exposed bugs will not be
	forced on package/extension/application authors until Tcl 8.5.

2005-06-24  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize):
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclPreserve.c (TclFinalizePreserve): Changed the
	finalization logic so that Tcl_Preserve finalizes after exit
	handlers run; a lot of code called from Tk's exit handlers
	presumes tha Tcl_Preserve will still work even from an exit
	handler.  Also, made the assertion check that no exit handlers
	are created in Tcl_Finalize conditional on TCL_MEM_DEBUG to
	avoid spurious panics in the "stable" release.

2005-06-24  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/auto.tcl:	Make file safe to re-[source] without
	destroying registered auto_mkindex_parser hooks.

2005-06-23  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: fixed useversion glob pattern to accept
	multi-digit patchlevels.

2005-06-23  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinChan.c: More rewriting of __asm__ blocks that
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: implement SEH in GCC, because mingw's
	gcc 3.4.2 is not as forgiving of violations committed by
	the old code and caused panics. [Bug 1225957]

2005-06-23  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in (install-private-headers): rewrite tclPort.h when
	installing private headers to remove ../unix relative #include path to
	tclUnixPort.h (which is incorrect at the installed location).

2005-06-22  Kevin Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclInt.h:			    Changed the finalization
	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize):	    logic to defer the
	* generic/tclIO.c (TclFinalizeIOSubsystem): shutdown of the pipe
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c (TclFinalizePipes):    management until after
	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclFinalizePipes):	    all channels have been
	    closed, in order to avoid a situation where the Windows
	    PipeCloseProc2 would re-establish the exit handler after exit
	    handlers had already run, corrupting the heap. [Bug 1225727]
	Corrected a read of uninitialized memory in PipeCloseProc2, which (at
	least on certain configurations) caused a great number of tests to
	either fail or hang. [Bug 1225044]

2005-06-22  Andreas Kupries <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Followup to change made on 2005-06-18 by Daniel
	Steffen. There are compilers (*) who error out on the redefinition of
	WORDS_BIGENDIAN. We have to undef the previous definition (on the
	command line) first to make this acceptable. (*): AIX native.

2005-06-22  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFile.c:	Potential buffer overflow. [Bug 1225571]
	Thanks to Pat Thoyts for discovery and fix.

	* tests/safe.test:	Backport performance improvement from
	reduced $::auto_path.

2005-06-21  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winDde.test: Added some waits to the dde server script to
	let event processing run after we create the dde server and before
	we exit the server process. This avoids 'server did not respond'
	errors.

2005-06-21  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: Corrected a problem where a directory name
	containing a colon can crash the process on Windows [Bug 1194458]
	* tests/fileName.test: Added test for [file split] and [file join]
	with a name containing a colon.
	* win/tclWinPipe.c: Reverted davygrvy's changes of 2005-04-19;
	they cause multiple failures in io.test. [Bug 1225044, still open]

2005-06-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Made the walk of the active trace list aware
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	of the direction of trace scanning, so the
	* generic/tclInt.h:	proper correction can be made. [Bug 1224585]
	* tests/trace.test (trace-34.2,3):

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteTrace):	Added missing walk of the
	* tests/trace.test (trace-34.1):	list of active traces to
	cleanup references to traces being deleted. [Bug 1201035]

2005-06-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3: added missing Tcl_GlobTypeData documentation [Bug
	935853]

2005-06-18  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: ensure WORDS_BIGENDIAN is defined correctly with
	fat compiles on Darwin (i.e. ppc and i386 at the same time), the
	configure AC_C_BIGENDIAN check is not sufficient in this case because
	a single run of the compiler builds for two architectures with
	different endianness.

	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): add -headerpad_max_install_names to LDFLAGS to
	ensure we can always relocate binaries with install_name_tool.

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2005-06-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

2005-06-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in (html): add BUILD_HTML_FLAGS optional var
	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: add a --useversion to prevent
	confusion when multiple Tcl source dirs exist.

	* changes: updated for 8.4.10 release (porter)

2005-05-31  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: the notifier thread is now created as
	joinable thread and it is properly joined in Tcl_FinalizeNotifier.
	This is an attempt to fix [Bug 1082283]

2005-05-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (TclpFinalizeThreadData): move tlsKey defn
	to top of file and clarify name (was 'key'). [Bug 1204064]

2005-05-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:	    Bumped patchlevel to 8.4.10
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:

	* win/configure, win/configure.in:

2005-05-26  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: moved & corrected EMBEDDED_BUILD check.

	* unix/configure.in: corrected framework finalization to softlink
	stub library to Versions/8.x subdir instead of Versions/Current.
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2005-05-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TimeObjCmd): add necessary cast

	* unix/configure, unix/configure.in: ensure false Tcl.framework is
	only created with --enable-framework

2005-05-24  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/env.test: added DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH to the list of env vars
	that need to be handled specially.

	* macosx/Makefile:
	* macosx/README:
	* macosx/Tcl-Info.plist.in (new file):
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: moved all Darwin framework build support from
	macosx/Makefile into the standard unix configure/make buildsystem, the
	macosx/Makefile is no longer required to build Tcl.framework (but its
	functionality is still available for backwards compatibility).
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (TclLoadFile):
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c: added support for [load]ing .bundle binaries in
	addition to .dylib's: .bundle's can be [unload]ed (unlike .dylib's),
	and can be [load]ed from memory, e.g. directly from VFS without
	needing to be written out to a temporary location first. [Bug 1202209]
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TimeObjCmd): change [time] called with a
	count > 1 to return a string with a float value instead of a rounded
	off integer. [Bug 1202178]

2005-05-20  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParseExpr.c: removed unreferenced stack variable "errMsg"
	probably included by fixing [Bug 1201589] (see below).

2005-05-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclParseExpr.c:	Corrected parser to recognize all
	boolean literals accepted by Tcl_GetBoolean, including prefixes like
	"y" and "f", and to allow "eq" and "ne" as function names in the
	proper context. [Bug 1201589]

2005-05-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c (Tcl_InitNotifier): fixed crashing
	CFRelease of runLoopSource in Tcl_InitNotifier (reported by Zoran):
	CFRunLoopAddSource doesn't CFRetain, so can only CFRelease the
	runLoopSource in Tcl_FinalizeNotifier.

2005-05-14  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): made use of CoreFoundation API configurable
	and added test of CoreFoundation availablility to allow building on
	ppc64, replaced HAVE_CFBUNDLE by HAVE_COREFOUNDATION; test for
	availability of Tiger or later OSSpinLockLock API.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* macosx/tclMacOSXNotify.c (new file): when CoreFoundation is
	available, use new CFRunLoop based notifier: allows easy integration
	with other event loops on Mac OS X, in particular the TkAqua Carbon
	event loop is now integrated via a standard tcl event source (instead
	of TkAqua upon loading having to finalize the exsting notifier and
	replace it with its custom version). [Patch 1202052]

	* tests/unixNotfy.test: don't run unthreaded tests on Darwin since
	notifier may be using threads even in unthreaded core.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): test for thread-unsafe realpath durning
	configure, as Darwin 7 and later realpath is threadsafe.

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c:
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: fixed gcc 4.0 warnings.

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2005-05-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/string.test: string-10.[21-30]
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): add extra checks to
	prevent possible UMR in unichar cmp function for string map.

2005-05-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/configure: correct Solaris 10 (5.10) check and
	add support for x86_64 Solaris cc builds.

2005-04-29  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/FileSystem.3: Backport of doc fix. [Bug 1172401]

2005-04-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl:	Corrected flaw in interactive command
	* tests/main.test:	auto-completion. [Bug 1191409]

	* tests/unixInit.test (7.1):	Alternative fix for the
	2005-04-22 commit.

2005-04-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* compat/string.h: fixed memchr() protoype for __APPLE__ so that we
	build on Mac OS X 10.1 again.

	* generic/tclNotify.c (TclFinalizeNotifier): fixed notifier not being
	finalized in unthreaded core (was testing for notifier initialization
	in current thread by checking thread id != 0 but thread id is always 0
	in untreaded core).

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_WaitForEvent): sync with HEAD: only declare
	and use timeout var in unthreaded core.

	* unix/Makefile.in: added @PLAT_SRCS@ to SRCS and split out
	NOTIFY_SRCS from UNIX_SRCS for parity with UNIX_OBJS & NOTIFY_OBJS.

	* unix/configure.in: only run check for broken strstr implementation
	if AC_REPLACE_FUNCS(strstr) hasn't already determined that strstr is
	unavailable, otherwise compat/strstr.o will be used twice (resulting
	in duplicate symbol link errors on Mac OS X 10.1)

	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): added configure checks for recently added
	linker flags -single_module and -search_paths_first to allow building
	with older tools (and on Mac OS X 10.1), use -single_module in
	SHLIB_LD and not just T{CL,K}_SHLIB_LD_EXTRAS, added unexporting from
	Tk of symbols from libtclstub to avoid duplicate symbol warnings,
	added PLAT_SRCS definition for Mac OS X.
	(SC_MISSING_POSIX_HEADERS): added caching of dirent.h check.
	(SC_TCL_64BIT_FLAGS): fixed 'checking for off64_t' message output.

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2005-04-22  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	Corrected intrep-dependence of
	* tests/string.test:	[string is boolean] [Bug 1187123]

2005-04-22  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (7.1): fixed failure when running tests with
	-tmpdir arg not set to working dir.

2005-04-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclGet.c (Tcl_GetInt):	Corrected error that did not
	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_GetIntFromObj): permit 0x80000000 to be
	recognized as an integer on TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG systems [Bug 1090869]

2005-04-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/winPipe.test (winpipe-6.2): remove -blocking 1 as this one
	can truly block.

2005-04-19  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: The pipe channel driver now respects the -blocking
	option when closing. The windows pipe driver now has the same behavior
	as the UNIX side. This change is to avoid a hung shell when exiting
	due to open pipes that refuse to close in a graceful manner.
	* doc/open.n: Added a note about -blocking 0 and lack of exit status
	as it had never been documented. [Bug 947693]

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

	Scripts that use async pipes on windows, must (like the UNIX side) set
	-blocking to 1 before calling [close] to receive the exit status.

	* tests/winPipe.test (winpipe-6.1/2): added 'fconfigure $f -blocking
	1' so the exit status can be acquired.

2005-04-13  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SetChannelBufferSize): Lowest size limit
	* tests/io.test:	changed from ten bytes to one byte. Need for
	* tests/iogt.test:	this change was proven by Ross Cartlidge
	<rossc@cisco.com> where [read stdin 1] was grabbing 10 bytes followed
	by starting a child process that was intended to continue reading from
	stdin. Even with -buffersize set to one, nine chars were getting lost
	by the buffersize over reading for the native read() caused by [read].

2005-04-12  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* compat/strstr.c: Added default definition of NULL to accommodate
	building on systems with badly broken headers. [Bug 1175161]

2005-04-09  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/README: updated requirements for OS & developer tool versions
	+ other small fixes/cleanup.

	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): added -single_module linker flag to
	TCL_SHLIB_LD_EXTRAS and TK_SHLIB_LD_EXTRAS.
	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2005-04-05  Zoran Vasiljevic  <vasiljevic@users.sourceforge.net>

	Set of changes correcting huge memory waste (not a leak) when a thread
	exits. This has been introduced in 8.4.7 within an attempt to
	correctly cleanup after ourselves when Tcl library is being unloaded
	with the Tcl_Finalize() call.

	This fixes the [Bug 1178445].

	* generic/tclInt.h: added prototypes for TclpFreeAllocCache() and
	TclFreeAllocCache()

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c: modified TclFinalizeThreadAlloc() to
	explicitly call TclpFreeAllocCache with the NULL-ptr as argument
	signalling cleanup of private tsd key used only by the threading
	allocator.

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c: fixed TclpFreeAllocCache() to recognize when
	being called with NULL argument. This is a signal for it to clean up
	the tsd key associated with the threading allocator.

	* win/tclWinThrd.c: renamed TclWinFreeAllocCache to TclpFreeAllocCache
	and fixed to recognize when being called with NULL argument. This is a
	signal for it to clean up the tsd key associated with the threading
	allocator.

2005-04-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprSrandFunc):	Replaced incursions into the
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetIntForIndex): intreps of numeric types with
	simpler calls of Tcl_GetIntFromObj and Tcl_GetLongFromObj, now that
	those routines are better behaved wrt shimmering. [Patch 1177129]

2005-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tcl.m4, win/configure: do not require cygpath in macros to
	allow msys alone as an alternative.

	* win/tclWinTime.c (TclpGetDate): use time_t for 'time' [Bug 1163422]

2005-03-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileIncrCmd):	Corrected checks for
	immediate operand usage to permit leading space and sign characters.
	Restores more efficient bytecode for [incr x -1] that got lost in the
	CONST string reforms of Tcl 8.4. [Bug 1165671]

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx,TclEvalTokensStandard):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj):
	* tests/basic.test (basic-46.4):	Restored recursion limit
	* tests/parse.test (parse-19.*):	testing in nested command
	substitutions within direct script evaluation (Tcl_EvalEx) that got
	lost in the parser reforms of Tcl 8.1. Added tests for correct
	behavior. [Bug 1115904]

2005-03-15  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* tests/winFCMd.test: fix to 'file pathtype' and 'file norm' failures
	on reserved filenames like 'COM1:', etc.

2005-03-15  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclClock.c:
	* generic/tclDate.c:
	* generic/tclGetDate.y:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* unix/tclUnixTime.c:
	* win/tclWinTime.c:	Replaced 'unsigned long' variable holding
	times with 'Tcl_WideInt', to cope with systems on which a time_t is
	wider than a long (Win64) [Bug 1163422]
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: Regen

2005-03-15  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	from the OpenBSD ports tree.

2005-03-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclCheckInterpTraces):	Corrected mistaken
	cast of ClientData to (TraceCommandInfo *) when not warranted. Thanks

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Better use of [glob -types] to avoid
	* tests/tcltest.test:	failed attempts to [source] a directory, and
	similar matters. Thanks to "mpettigr". [Bug 1119798]

	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl: Bump to tcltest 2.2.8

2005-02-23  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	Tcl_UniCharLen.

2005-02-16  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/variable.n: fix for [Bug 1124160], variables are detected by
	[info vars] but not by [info locals].

2005-02-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/Makefile.in: remove SHLIB_LD_FLAGS (only for AIX, inlined
	* unix/tcl.m4:	    into SHLIB_LD).  Combine AIX-* and AIX-5
	* unix/configure:   branches in SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS.
	Correct gcc builds for AIX-4+ and HP-UX-11.

2005-02-10  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjEx):
	* tests/basic.test (basic-26.2): preserve the arguments passed to TEOV
	in the pure-list branch, in case the list shimmers away. Fix for [Bug

	* unix/configure: autoconf-2.13

2005-01-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinChan.c (FileCloseProc): Invoke TclpCutFileChannel() to
	remove a FileInfo from the thread local list before deallocating it.
	This should have been done via an earlier call to Tcl_CutChannel, but
	I was running into a crash in the next call to Tcl_CutChannel during
	the IO finalization stage.

2005-01-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	longstanding inconsistency in the treatment of the TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY
	flag revealed by testing the 2004-09-09 commits against Itcl.
	TCL_NAMESPACE_ONLY now acts as specified in the pre-function
	comment, forcing resolution in the passed in context namespace. It has
	been incorrectly forcing resolution in the interp's current namespace.

2004-09-10  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_CONCAT1): added a peephole optimisation
	for concatting an empty string. This enables replacing the idiom 'K $x

2004-09-07  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclTimer.c: Removed a premature optimisation that attempted
	to store the assoc data in the client data; the optimisation caused a
	bug that [after] would overwrite its imports. [Bug 1016167]

2004-07-30  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Darwin: instead of setting PLAT_OBJS

	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main, StdinProc):  Append newline only to

	been called for the current thread. This fixes [Bug 770053] again.
	Hopefully this time w/o unwanted side-effects.

2004-07-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.h (CHANNEL_INCLOSE):	   New flag. Set in Tcl_Close
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_UnregisterChannel): while the close callbacks
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Close):		   are run. Checked in
	Tcl_Close and Tcl_Unregister to prevent recursive call of [close] in
	the close-callbacks. This is a possible error made by implementors of
	virtual filesystems based on 'tclvfs', thinking that they have to
	close the channel in the close handler for the filesystem.

2004-07-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c:
	* generic/tclIO.h:
	Not reverting, but #ifdef'ing the changes from May 19, 2004 out of the
	core. This removes the ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** for channel
	drivers it introduced. This has become possible due to Expect gaining
	a BlockModeProc and now handling blockingg and non-blocking modes
	correctly. Thus [Bug 943274] is still fixed if a recent enough version
	of Expect is used.

	* doc/CrtChannel.3: Added warning about usage of a channel without a
	BlockModeProc.

2004-07-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@pliers.activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_PutsObjCmd): Added length check to the old
	depreceated newline syntax, to ensure that only "nonewline" is
	accepted. [Bug 985869] (mistachkin)

2004-07-13  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README, generic/tcl.h, tools/tcl.wse.in:	      bumped to
	* unix/configure, unix/configure.in, unix/tcl.spec:   patchlevel
	* win/README.binary, win/configure, win/configure.in: 8.4.7

2004-07-13  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (NewThreadProc): Fixed broken build on Windows
	caused by missing TCL_THREAD_CREATE_RETURN. This is backported from
	HEAD. Thnx to Kevin Kenny for spotting this.

2004-07-03  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprRoundFunc):
	* tests/expr-old.test (39.1): added support for wide integers to
	round(); [Bug 908375], reported by Hemang Lavana.

2004-07-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/regcomp.c (stid): correct minor pointer size error

	* generic/tclPipe.c (TclCreatePipeline): Add 2>@1 as a special
	* tests/exec.test: case redir of stderr to the result output.

2004-07-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileSystem.test: new tests backported
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: compilation fix for VC++5.2

2004-06-29  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* library/safe.tcl: Make sure that the temporary variable is
	local to the namespace and not inadvertently global. [Bug 981733]

2004-06-22  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c: See bug report for more information about what it
	does. [Bug 770053]

	* tests/unixNotfy.test: rewritten to use tcltest::threadReap to
	gracefully wait for the test thread to exit. Otherwise we got a race
	condition with main thread exiting before the test thread. This
	exposed the long-standing Tcl lib issue with resource
	garbage-collection on application exit.

2004-06-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (DllMain, _except_dllmain_detach_handler)
	(TclpCheckStackSpace, _except_checkstackspace_handler, TclWinCPUID)
	(_except_TclWinCPUID_detach_handler):
	* win/tclWinChan.c (Tcl_MakeFileChannel)
	(_except_makefilechannel_handler):
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, _except_dorenamefile_handler)
	(DoCopyFile, _except_docopyfile_handler):
	Rework pushing of exception handler function pointer so that compiling
	with gcc -O3 works. Remove empty function call to avoid compiler
	warning. Mark the DllMain function as noinline to avoid compiler error
	from duplicated asm labels in generated code.

2004-06-14  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winDde.test: Fixed -async test
	* win/tclWinDde.c: Backported the fix from 8.5 to avoid hanging in the
	presence of applications that do not process Window messages.

2004-06-10  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclDecls.h:	     Regenerated on a unix box. The Win/DOS
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:     EOLs from the last regen screwed up
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: compilation with an older gcc.
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:

2004-06-10  Zoran Vasiljevic <vasiljevic@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: partially corrected [Bug 932314]. Also,
	corrected return values of Tcl_FSChdir() to reflect those of the
	underlying platform-specific call. Originally, return codes were mixed
	with those of Tcl.

2004-06-08  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c: handle warning [Bug 969066]

2004-06-05  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tcl.h: Corrected Tcl_WideInt declarations so that the mingw
	build works again.
	* generic/tclDecls.h:			Changes to the tests for
	* generic/tclInt.decls:			clock frequency in Tcl_WinTime
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:		so that any clock frequency is
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:		accepted provided that all
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:		CPU's in the system share a
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:		common chip, and hence,
	* tests/platform.test (platform-1.3):	presumably, a common clock.
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclWinCPUID):	This change necessitated a
	* win/tclWinTest.c (TestwincpuidCmd)	small burst of assembly code
	* win/tclWinTime.c (Tcl_GetTime):	to read CPU ID information,
	which was added as TclWinCPUID in the internal Stubs. To test this
	code in the common case of a single-processor machine, a
	'testwincpuid' command was added to tclWinTest.c, and a test case in
	platform.test. Thanks to Jeff Godfrey and Richard Suchenwirth for
	reporting this bug. [Bug 976722]

2004-05-27  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/clock.test: Added a single test for the presence of %G in
	[clock format], and conditioned out the clock-10.x series if they're
	all going to fail because of a broken strftime() call. [Bug 961714]

2004-05-27  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c:
	* tests/encoding.test: added support and tests for translating
	embedded null characters between real nullbytes and the internal
	representation on input/output. [Bug 949905]

2004-05-26  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Correction to debug prints and testing
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:	if TCLTEST_OPTIONS value. Corrected
	* tests/tcltest.test:		double increment of numTestFiles in
	-singleproc 1 configurations. Updated tcltest-19.1 to tcltest 2.1
	behavior. Corrected tcltest-25.3 to not falsely report a failure in
	tcltest.test. Bumped to tcltest 2.2.6. [Bugs 960560, 960926]

2004-05-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/http.n (http::config): add -urlencoding option (default utf-8)
	* library/http/http.tcl:     that specifies encoding conversion of
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl: args for http::formatQuery.  Previously
	* tests/http.test:	     undefined, RFC 2718 says it should be
	utf-8. 'http::config -urlencoding {}' returns previous behavior,
	which will throw errors processing non-latin-1 chars. Bumped http
	package to 2.5.0.

2004-05-25  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/winFCmd.test: Correct test for the presence of a CD-ROM so
	that it doesn't misdetect some other sort of filesystem with a
	write-protected root as being a CD-ROM drive. [Bug 918267]

2004-05-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (VerifyExprObjType): use GET_WIDE_OR_INT to
	properly have tclIntType used for smaller values. This corrects TclX
	bug 896727 and any other 3rd party extension that created math
	functions but was not yet WIDE_INT aware in them.

2004-05-24  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/set.n: accurate description of name resolution process,
	referring to namespace.n for details [Bug 959180]

2004-05-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclObjUnsetVar2): backported fix [Bug 735335] and
	new (in tcl8.4) exteriorisations of [Bug 736729] due to the use of
	tclNsVarNameType obj types. The consequences of [Bug 736729] should be
	the same as in tcl8.3 and previous versions. The use of
	tclNsVarNameType objs is still disabled, pending a decision by the
	release manager.

2004-05-19  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpMatchInDirectory): fix for an issue where
	there was a sneak path from Tcl_DStringFree to SetErrorCode(0). The
	result was that the error code could be reset between a call to
	FindFirstFile and the check of its status return, leading to a bizarre
	error return of {POSIX unknown {No error}}. (Found in unplanned test -
	no incident logged at SourceForge.)

2004-05-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c: Fixed [SF Tcl Bug 943274]. This is the same problem
	* generic/tclIO.h: as [SF Tcl Bug 462317], see ChangeLog entry
	2001-09-26. The fix done at that time is incomplete. It is possible to
	get around it if the actual read operation is defered and not executed
	in the event handler itself. Instead of tracking if we are in an read
	caused by a synthesized fileevent we now track if the OS has delivered
	a true event = actual data and bypass the driver if a read finds that
	there is no actual data waiting. The flag is cleared by a short or
	full read. [[this bug amended 2004-07-14]]

2004-05-18  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* compat/strftime.c (_fmt, ISO8601Week):
	* doc/clock.n:
	* tests/clock.test: Major rework to the handling of ISO8601 week
	numbers. Now passes all the %G and %V test cases on Windows, Linux and
	Solaris [Bugs 500285, 500389, and 852944]

2004-05-17  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb.@acm.org>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:	     Restored TclpTime_t kludge to all places
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: where it appeared before the changes of
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h	     14 May, because use of native time_t in
	* unix/tclUnixTime.h	     its place requires the 8.5 header
	* win/tclWinTime.h:	     reforms. [Bug 955146]

2004-05-17  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3: Documented type of 'offset' argument to Tcl_Seek
	was wrong. [Bug 953374]

2004-05-14  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:	     Promoted TclpLocaltime and TclpGmtime
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:     from Unix-specific stubs to the generic
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: internal Stubs table. Reran 'genstubs'
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:

	* generic/tclClock.c: Changed a buggy 'GMT' timezone specification to
			      the correct 'GMT0'. [Bug 922848]

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c: Moved TclpGmtime and TclpLocaltime to
			      unix/tclUnixTime.c where they belong.

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c (TclpGmtime, TclpLocaltime, TclpGetTimeZone,
	(ThreadSafeGMTime[removed], ThreadSafeLocalTime[removed],
	(SetTZIfNecessary, CleanupMemory): Restructured to make sure that the
	same mutex protects all calls to localtime, gmtime, and tzset. Added a
	check in front of those calls to make sure that the TZ env var hasn't
	changed since the last call to tzset, and repeat tzset if necessary.
	[Bug 940278] Removed a buggy test of the Daylight Saving Time
	information in 'gettimeofday' in favor of applying 'localtime' to a
	known value. [Bug 922848]

	* tests/clock.test (clock-3.14): Added test to make sure that changes
	to $env(TZ) take effect immediately.

	* win/tclWinTime.c (TclpLocaltime, TclpGmtime): Added porting layer
	for 'localtime' and 'gmtime' calls.

2004-05-10  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Append a space when the path
	got primed.
	(TclpCreateProcess): When under NT, with no console, and executing a
	DOS application, the path priming does not need an ending space as
	BuildCommandLine() will append one for us.

2004-05-07  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/unset.n: added upvar.n to the "see also" list

2004-05-05  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c: TclSetLibraryPath's use of caching the stringrep
	of the pathPtr object to TclGetLibraryPath called from another thread
	was ineffective if the original's stringrep had been invalidated as
	what happens when it gets muted to a list.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c: Added FreeEncoding(systemEncoding) in
	TclFinalizeEncodingSubsystem because its ref count was incremented in
	TclInitEncodingSubsystem.

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: Structured Exception Handling added around
	Tcl_Finalize called from DllMain's DLL_PROCESS_DETACH. We can't be
	100% assured that Tcl is being unloaded by the OS in a stable
	condition and we need to protect the exit handlers should the stack be
	in a hosed state. AT&T style assembly for SEH under MinGW included,
	too. [Patch 858493]

	Also added DisableThreadLibraryCalls() for the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH
	case. We're not interested in knowing about DLL_THREAD_ATTACH, so
	disable the notices.

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclThread.c:
	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:  Provisions made so masterLock, initLock,
	allocLock and joinLock mutexes can be recovered during Tcl_Finalize.

	* win/tclWinSock.c:
	(SocketThreadExitHandler): Don't call TerminateThread when
	WaitForSingleObject returns a timeout. Tcl_Finalize called from
	DllMain will pause all threads. Trust that the thread will get the
	close notice at a later time if it does ever wake up before being
	cleaned up by the system anyway.
	(SocketEventProc): connect errors should fire both the readable and
	writable handlers because this is how it works on UNIX. [Bug 794839]

	* win/coffbase.txt: Added the tls extension to the list of preferred
	load addresses.

2004-05-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.10): Test correction for Mac OSX.
	Be sure to consistently compare normalized path names. Thanks to
	Steven Abner (tauvan). [Bug 948177]

2004-05-05  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* doc/CrtObjCmd.3: Remove reference to Tcl_RenameCommand; there is no
	such API. [Bug 848440]

2004-05-04  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSChdir):  Work-around crash condition
	* tests/winFCmd.test (winFCmd-16.12): triggered when $HOME is
	volumerelative (ie 'C:').

	* tests/fileName.test (filename-12.9): use C:/ instead of the first
	item in file volumes - that's usually A:/, which for most will have
	nothing in it.

2004-05-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test: Test corrections for Mac OSX.  Thanks to Steven
	Abner (tauvan). [Bug 947440]

2004-05-03  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	Applied [SF Tcl Patch 868853], fixing a mem leak in TtySetOptionProc.
	Report and Patch provided by Stuart Cassoff <stwo@users.sf.net>.

2004-05-03  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace):
	* tests/stack.test (stack-3.1): Fix for undetected stack overflow in
	TclReExec on Windows. [Bug 947070]

2004-05-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/init.tcl:	Corrected unique prefix matching of
	interactive command completion in [unknown]. [Bug 946952]

2004-05-02  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c (TclObjInvokeProc):
	* tests/proc.test (proc-3.6): fix for bad quoting of multi-word proc
	names in error messages [Bug 942757]

2004-04-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_SetChannelOption): Fixed [Bug 930851]. When
	changing the eofchar we have to zap the related flags to prevent them
	from prematurely aborting the next read.

2004-04-07  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: define TCL_LIB_FLAG, TCL_BUILD_LIB_SPEC,
	TCL_LIB_SPEC and TCL_PACKAGE_PATH in tclConfig.sh.

2004-04-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-3.1):	Default encoding on Darwin
	systems is utf-8. Thanks to Steven Abner (tauvan). [Bug 928808]

2004-04-06  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdAH.test (cmdAH-18.2): Added constraint because
	access(...,X_OK) is defined to be permitted to be meaningless when
	running as root, and OSX exhibits this. [Bug 929892]

2004-04-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test: Corrected constraint typos: "nonRoot" ->
	"notRoot". Thanks to Steven Abner (tauvan). [Bug 928353]

2004-03-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/msgcat.n: Clarified message catalog file encodings. [Bug 811457]
	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl ([mcset], [ConvertLocale], [Init]):
	Corrected [mcset] to be able to successfully set a translation to
	the empty string. [mcset $loc $src {}] was incorrectly set the $loc
	translation of $src back to $src. Also changed [ConvertLocale] to
	minimally require a non-empty "language" part in the locale value. If
	not, an error raised prompts [Init] to keep looking for a valid locale
	value, or ultimately fall back on the "C" locale. [Bug 811461]
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:	Bump to msgcat 1.3.2.

2004-03-31  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclObj.c (HashObjKey): Make sure this hashes the whole
	string rep of the object, instead of missing the last character.

2004-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclEncoding.c (TclFindEncodings, Tcl_FindExecutable):
	* mac/tclMacInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):   Correct handling of UTF
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath): data that is actually
	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpFindExecutable):    "clean", allowing the
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):   loading of Tcl from paths
	that contain multi-byte chars on Windows [Bug 920667]

2004-03-28  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript): corrected possible segfault
	when a compilation returns TCL_OUTLINE_COMPILE after having grown the
	compile environment. [Bug 925121]

2004-03-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinInt.h: define VER_PLATFORM_WIN32_CE if not already set.
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings): recognize WIN32_CE
	as a unicode (WCHAR) platform.

2004-03-15  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript):
	* tests/compile.test (compile-3.5): corrected wrong test and behaviour
	in the earlier fix for [Bug 705406]; Don Porter reported this as [Bug
	735055], and provided the solution. Fixed in HEAD on 2003-05-09, but
	backport to 8-4-branch was wrongly omitted; re-reported as [Bug
	916795] by Roy Terry, diagnosed by dgp.

2004-03-08  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:  Fix to 'glob -path' near the root
	* tests/fileName.test:	  of the filesystem. [Bug 910525]

2004-03-01  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	*** 8.4.6 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS):	Allow 64-bit enabling on
	IRIX64-6.5* systems. [Bug 218561]
	* unix/configure:	autoconf-2.13

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclCheckInterpTraces):	The TIP 62
	* generic/tclTest.c (TestcmdtraceCmd):	implementation introduced a
	* tests/basic.test (basic-39.10):	bug by testing the CallFrame
	level instead of the iPtr->numLevels level when deciding what traces
	created by Tcl_Create(Obj)Trace to call. Added test to expose the
	error, and made fix. [Request 462580]

2004-02-26  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: fixed copyright year in Tcl.framework Info.plist

2004-02-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/basic.test:	Made several tests more robust to the
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:	list-quoting of path names that might
	* tests/exec.test:	contain Tcl-special chars like { or [.
	* tests/io.test:	Should help us sort out Tcl Bug 554068.

2004-02-25  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TcpGetOptionProc): Stop memory leak with very
	long hostnames. [Bug 888777]

2004-02-25  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tests/winPipe.test:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c: backport of BuildCommandLine changes to mirror
	msvcrt's parse_cmdline() rules of quoting.

2004-02-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinInit.c (AppendEnvironment): Use the tail component of the
	passed in lib path instead of just blindly using lib+4. That worked
	when lib was "lib/..." but fails for other values. Thanks go to
	Patrick Samson for pointing this out.

2004-02-17  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Changed -verbose default value to
	{body error} so that detailed information on unexpected errors in
	tests is provided by default, even after the fix for [Bug 725253]

2004-02-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	(reverted due to test failures on Solaris, but not Win/Lin :/)
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: backport of rewrite of generic file

	and parts of [859251]

	* tests/unixInit.test: unixInit-7.1
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitPlatform): ensure the std fds exist to
	prevent crash condition [Bug 772288]

2004-02-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TclTraceExecutionObjCmd)
	(TclTraceCommandObjCmd): fix possible mem leak in trace info.

2004-02-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:	    update patchlevel to 8.4.6
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* unix/configure, unix/configure.in, unix/tcl.spec:
	* win/README.binary, win/configure, win/configure.in:

2004-02-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/clock.n:	Removed reference to non-existent [file ctime].

2004-02-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Corrected references to

	buffer. [Bug 405995]

2004-01-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_GlobObjCmd):  Latest changes to
	management of the interp result by Tcl_GetIndexFromObj() exposed
	improper interp result management in the [glob] command procedure.
	Corrected by adopting the Tcl_SetObjResult(Tcl_NewStringObj) pattern.
	This stopped a segfault in test filename-11.36.

2004-01-13  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct, Tcl_WrongNumArgs):
	Create fresh objects instead of using the one currently in the
	interpreter, which isn't guaranteed to be fresh and unshared. The
	cost for the core will be minimal because of the object cache, and
	this fixes. [Bug 875395]

2004-01-09  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to infinite loop in TclFinalizeFilesystem.

	('file normalize ~nobody') [Bug 858937]

2003-12-09  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:	#ifdef'd out declarations of errno which
	* tools/man2tcl.c:	are known to cause problems with recent
				glibc. [Bug 852369]

2003-12-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	Bumped patch level to 8.4.5.1 to distinguish
	* unix/configure.in:	CVS snapshots from 8.4.5 release.
	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* win/configure.in:

	* unix/configure:	autoconf (2.13)
	* win/configure:

2003-12-02  Donal K. Fellows  <donal.k.fellows@man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBinary.c (DeleteScanNumberCache, ScanNumber): Made
	the numeric scan-value cache have proper references to the objects
	within it so strange patterns of writes won't cause references to
	freed objects. Thanks to Paul Obermeier for the report. [Bug 851747]

2003-12-01  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* doc/lset.n: fix typo [Bug 852224]

	* tests/reg.test:	[Bugs 230589, 504785, 505048, 703709, 840258]

2003-11-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/cmdMZ.test (cmdMZ-1.4): change to nonPortable as more
	systems are using permissions caching, and this isn't really a Tcl
	controlled issue.

2003-11-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: improve AIX --enable-64bit handling

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.10): re-enabled.
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):	Alternative fix
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpInitLibraryPath):	for [Bug 832657]
	that should not run afoul of startup constraints.

	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:	Added safeguards so that registry
	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl:	and dde packages are not offered
	* win/tclWinDde.c:	on non-Windows platforms.  Bumped to
	* win/tclWinReg.c:	registry 1.1.3 and dde 1.2.2.

2003-11-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/unixInit.test (unixInit-2.10): mark as knownBug
	* generic/tclEncoding.c (TclFindEncodings): revert patch from
	2003-11-05.  It wasn't valid in the sensitive startup init phase
	and broke Windows from working at all.

2003-11-07  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: optimized builds define NDEBUG to turn off
	ThreadAlloc range checking.

2003-11-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (TclFindEncodings):	Normalize the path
	of the executable before passing to TclpInitLibraryPath() to avoid

	error messages) is freed in both code paths.

2003-10-23  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (Tcl_MakeFileChannel): Applied [Patch 813606]
	fixing [Bug 813087]. Detection of sockets was off for Mac OS X which
	implements pipes as local sockets. The new code ensures that only IP
	sockets are detected as such.

2003-10-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c (TcpWatchProc): Watch for FD_CLOSE too when asked
	for writable events by the generic layer.
	(SocketEventProc): Generate a writable event too when a close is
	detected.

	Together the changes fix [Bug 599468].

2003-10-22  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (FsListMounts, FsAddMountsToGlobResult): New

2003-10-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FileObjCmd): Changed FILE_ prefix for option
	enumeration to FCMD_ to prevent collision with symbols defined by
	Cygwin/Mingw32 on NT. [Bug 822528]

2003-10-21   Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: fixed incorrect html generated for .IP/.TP
	lists, now use <DL><DT>...<DD>...<P><DT>...<DD>...</DL> instead of
	illegal <DL><P><DT>...<DD>...<P><DT>...<DD>...</DL>. Added skipping of
	directives directly after .TP to avoid them being used as item
	descriptions, e.g. .TP\n.VS in clock.n.

2003-10-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Applied the patch coming with
	[Bug 805605] to the code, fixing the incorrect use of ispace noted by
	Ronald Dauster <ronaldd@users.sourceforge.net>.

2003-10-14  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclAppInit.c (sigHandler): Punt gracefully if exitToken has

	value of alarm. [Bug 664755] (english)

2003-10-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Save and restore the iPtr->flag bits that
	control the state of errorCode and errorInfo management when calling
	"leave" execution traces, so that all error information of the traced
	command is still available whether traced or not. Thanks to Yahalom
	Emet. [Bug 760947]

2003-10-08  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestNumUtfCharsCmd): Command to allow finer
	access to Tcl_NumUtfChars for testing.
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_NumUtfChars): Corrected string length
	determining when the length parameter is negative; the terminator is a
	zero byte, not (necessarily) a \u0000 character. [Bug 769812]

2003-10-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/exec.test:		Corrected temporary file management

	* tests/socket.test:
	* tests/source.test:

	* tests/fCmd.test:	Run tests with the [temporaryDirectory] as
	the current directory, so that tests can depend on ability to write
	files.	[Bug 575837]

	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3:	Updated Tcl_Tell and Tcl_Seek documentation
	to reflect that they now return Tcl_WideInt (TIP 72) [Bug 787537]

	* tests/io.test:	Corrected several tests that failed when paths
	* tests/ioCmd.test:	included regexp-special chars. [Bug 775394]

2003-10-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/regexp.test:		Matched [makeFile] with [removeFile].
	* tests/regexpComp.test:	[Bug 675652]

	* tests/fCmd.test (fCmd-8.2):	Test only that tilde-substitution
	happens, not for any particular result. [Bug 685991]

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG):	Corrected search path so
	that alpha and beta releases of Tcl are not favored. [Bug 608698]

	* tests/reg.test:	Corrected duplicate test names.
	* tests/resource.test:	[Bugs 710370, 710358]

	* tests/cmdMZ.test:	Updated [package require tcltest] lines to
	* tests/fileSystem.test:	indiciate that these test files
	* tests/notify.test:	use features of tcltest 2. [Bug 706114]
	* tests/parseExpr.test:
	* tests/unixNotfy.test:

2003-10-06  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: backport of volumerelative file normalization
	and 'file join' inconsistency fixes [Bug 767834, 813273].

2003-10-04  Chengye Mao <chengye.geo@yahoo.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: fixed a bug in BuildCommandLine.
	This bug built a command line with a missing space between
	tclpipe.dll and the following arguments.  It caused error
	in Windows 98 when exec command.com (e.g. dir) [Bug 789040]

2003-10-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Fixed error in ref count management of command
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	and execution traces that caused access to
	freed memory in trace-32.1. [Bug 811483]

2003-10-03  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/winFCmd.test:
	* doc/FileSystem.3: backported various test and documentation changes
	from HEAD. Backport of actual code fixes to follow.

	* macosx/Makefile: fixed redo prebinding bug when DESTDIR="".
	* mac/tclMacResource.c: fixed possible NULL dereference (bdesgraupes).

2003-09-29  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (CallCommandTraces):	Added safety bit
	* tests/trace.test:	masking to prevent any of the bit values
	TCL_TRACE_*_EXEC from leaking into the flags field of any Command
	struct. This does not fix [Bug 811483] but helps to contain some of
	its worst symptoms. Also backported the corrections to test trace-28.4
	from Vince Darley.

2003-09-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* library/http/http.tcl (geturl): Correctly check the type of
	boolean-valued options. [Bug 811170]

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_FRAMEWORK): Added note to make it clearer
	that this is an OSX feature, not a general Unix feature. [Bug 619440]

2003-09-28  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: The windows port of expect can call
	TclWinAddProcess before any of the other pipe functions. Added a
	missing PipeInit() call to make sure the initialization happens.

2003-09-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: ensure SYMROOT exists if OBJROOT is overridden on
	command line. Replaced explict use of /usr/bin by ${BINDIR}.

2003-09-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:			Fixed [Bug 807243] where
	* tests/trace.test (trace-31,32.*):	the introspection results
	of both [trace info command] and [trace info execution] were getting
	co-mingled.  Thanks to Mark Saye for the report.

	* library/init.tcl (auto_load, auto_import):  Expanded Eric Melski's
	2000-01-28 fix for [Bug 218871] to all potentially troubled uses of
	[info commands] on input data, where glob-special characters could
	cause problems.

2003-09-19  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: adding (DE)CACHE_STACK_INFO() pairs to protect
	all calls that may cause traces on ::errorInfo or ::errorCode to
	corrupt the stack [Bug 804681]

2003-09-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/opt/optparse.tcl:	Overlooked dependence of opt 0.4.4
	* library/opt/pkgIndex.tcl:	on Tcl 8.2.  Bumped to opt 0.4.4.1.

2003-09-01  Zoran Vasiljevic <zoran@archiware.com>

	spaces were handled incorrectly.
	* tests/util.test:	Added new tests util-8.[2-6].

2003-08-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: recognize amd64 and ia32_on_win64 cpus and
	Windows CE platform.

2003-08-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:	Added escape so that non-Windows
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:	platforms do not try to use the
	registry package.  This can save a costly and pointless package
	search. Bumped to 1.3.1. Thanks to Dave Bodenstab. [Bug 781609]

2003-08-05  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (INST_INVOKE, INST_EVAL, INST_PUSH_RESULT):
	added a Tcl_ResetResult(interp) at each point where the interp's
	result is pushed onto the stack, to avoid keeping an extra reference
	that may cause costly Tcl_Obj duplication. Detected by Franco Violi,
	analyzed by Peter Spjuth and Donal Fellows. [Bug 781585]

2003-07-24  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* library/package.tcl: Fixed a typo that broke pkg_mkIndex -verbose.

	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test: Added a test for [pkg_mkIndex -verbose].

2003-07-23  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: changes to html-tcl & html-tk targets for
	compatibility with non-gnu makes.

	* unix/Makefile.in: added macosx/README to dist target.

2003-07-23  Pat Thoyts  <patthoyts@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinReg.c (OpenSubKey): Backported fix for [Bug 775976] which
	causes the registry set command to fail when built with VC7.
	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl: Incremented the version to 1.1.2.

2003-07-21  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* macosx/Makefile: added option to allow installing manpages in
	addition to default html help.

2003-07-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/Utf.3: Tightened up documentation of Tcl_UtfNext and Tcl_UtfPrev
	to better match the behaviour. [Bug 769895]

2003-07-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: correct MT-safety issues with filesystem
	records. [Bug 753315] (vasiljevic)

2003-07-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:	Corrected several instances of unsafe
	* generic/tclCompile.c:	truncation of UTF-8 strings that might break
	* generic/tclProc.c:	apart a multi-byte character. [Bug 760872]
	* library/init.tcl:
	* tests/init.test:

	* doc/tcltest.n:		Restored the [Eval] proc to replace
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	the [::puts] command when either the
	-output or -error option for [test] is in use, in order to capture
	data written to the output or error channels for comparison against
	what is expected. This is easier to document and agrees better with
	most user expectations than the previous attempt to replace [puts]
	only in the caller's namespace. Documentation made more precise on the
	subject. [Bug 706359]

	* doc/AddErrInfo.3:	Improved consistency of documentation by using
	* doc/CrtTrace.3:	"null" everywhere to refer to the character
	* doc/Encoding.3:	'\0', and using "NULL" everywhere to refer to
	* doc/Eval.3:		the value of a pointer that points to nowhere.
	* doc/GetIndex.3:	Also dropped references to ASCII that are no
	* doc/Hash.3:		longer true, and standardized on the
	* doc/LinkVar.3:	hyphenated spelling of "null-terminated".
	* doc/Macintosh.3:
	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3:
	* doc/SetVar.3:
	* doc/StringObj.3:
	* doc/Utf.3:

	* doc/CrtSlave.3 (Tcl_MakeSafe):  Removed warning about possible
	deprecation (no TIP on that).

2003-07-17  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: added var to allow overriding of tclsh used during
	html help building (Landon Fuller).

2003-07-16  Mumit Khan  <khan@nanotech.wisc.edu>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (SetFsPathFromAny): Add Cygwin specific code to
	convert POSIX filename to native format.
	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_TranslateFileName): And remove from here.
	(TclDoGlob): Adjust for cygwin and append / for dirs instead of \
	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpObjChdir): Use chdir on Cygwin. [Patch 679315]

2003-07-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/safe.tcl (FileInAccessPath): normalize paths before
	comparison. [Bug 759607] (myers)

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (NotifierThreadProc): correct size of found and
	word vars from int to long. [Bug 767578] (hgo)

2003-07-16  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/CrtSlave.3 (Tcl_MakeSafe): Updated documentation to strongly
	discourage use. IMHO code outside the core that uses this function is
	a bug... [Bug 655300]

2003-07-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tcl.h:       Add recognition of -DTCL_UTF_MAX=6 on the
	* generic/regcustom.h: make line to support UCS-4 mode. No config arg
	at this time, as it is not the recommended build mode.

	* generic/tclPreserve.c: In Result and Preserve'd routines, do not
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	 assume that ckfree == free, as that is not
	* generic/tclResult.c:	 always true. [Bug 756791] (fuller)

2003-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/Makefile.in: Don't define TCL_DBGX symbol for every compile.
	Instead, define TCL_PIPE_DLL only when compiling tclWinPipe.c. This
	will break other build systems, so they will need to remove the
	TCL_DBGX define and replace it with a define for TCL_PIPE_DLL.
	* win/makefile.vc: Ditto.
	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclpCreateProcess): Remove PREFIX_IDENT and
	DEBUG_IDENT from top of file. Use TCL_PIPE_DLL passed in from build
	env instead of trying to construct the dll name from already defined
	symbols. This approach is more flexible and better in the long run.

2003-07-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_GlobObjCmd):	[Bug 771840]
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSConvertToPathType):[Bug 771947]
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (GetModeFromPermString):	[Bug 771949]
	Silence compiler warnings about unreached lines.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl (ProcessFlags):	Corrected broken call
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:			to [lrange]. Bumped to
	version 2.2.4. [Bug 772333]

2003-07-15  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/dltest/pkga.c (Pkga_EqObjCmd): Fix typo that was causing a
	crash in load.test.

2003-07-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/array.n: Added some examples from David Welton [Patch 763312]

2003-07-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/http.n:  Updated SYNOPSIS to match actual syntax of commands.
	[Bug 756112]

	* unix/dltest/pkga.c:	Updated to not use Tcl_UtfNcmp and counted
	strings instead of strcmp (not defined in any #include'd header) and
	presumed NULL-terminated strings.

	* README:		Bumped patch level to 8.4.4 in anticipation
	* generic/tcl.h:	of another patch release.
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* win/README.binary:
	* win/configure.in:

	* unix/configure:	autoconf (2.13)
	* win/configure:

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileIfCmd):  Prior fix of Bug 711371
	on 2003-04-07 introduced a buffer overflow. Corrected. [Bug 771613]

2003-07-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (SortCompare): Cleared up confusing error
	message. [Bug 771539]

2003-07-15  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: Rewrote buildsystem for Mac OS X framework build to
	be purely make driven; in order to become independent of Apple's
	closed-source IDE and build tool. The changes are intended to be
	transparent to the Makefile user, all existing make targets and cmd
	line variable overrides should continue to work. Changed build to only
	include tcl specific html help in Tcl.framework, the tk specific html
	help is now included in Tk.framework.

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/jingham.pbxuser: Changed to purely call through to
	the make driven buildsystem; Tcl.framework is no longer assembled by
	ProjectBuilder. Set default SYMROOT in target options to simplify
	setting up PB (manually setting common build folder for tcl & tk no
	longer needed).

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: Added options to allow building only the
	tcl or tk html help files; the default behaviour with none of the new
	options is to build both, as before.

	* unix/Makefile.in: Added targets for building only the tcl or tk help.

	* macosx/README (new): Tcl specific excerpts of tk/macosx/README.

	* generic/tcl.h: Updated reminder comment about editing
	macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj when version number changes.

2003-07-11  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/binary.test (binary-46.*): Tests to help enforce the current
	behaviour.
	* doc/binary.n: Documented that [binary format a] and [binary scan a]
	do encoding conversion by dropping high bytes, unlike the rest of
	the core. [Bug 735364]

2003-07-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl:	Corrected [pkg_mkIndex] bug reported on
	comp.lang.tcl. The indexer was searching for newly indexed packages
	instead of newly provided packages.

2003-07-04  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/expr.n: Tighten up the wording of some operations. [Bug 758488]

	* tests/cmdAH.test: Made tests of [file mtime] work better on FAT
	filesystems. [Patch 760768]  Also a little general cleanup.

2003-06-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Add -ieee when compiling with cc and
	add -mieee when compiling with gcc under OSF1-V5 "Tru64" systems. [Bug
	748957]

2003-06-24  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/encoding.n: Corrected the docs to say that [source] uses the
	system encoding, which it always did anyway (since 8.1) [Bug 742100]

2003-06-23  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFCmd.c: fix to bad error message when trying to do 'file
	copy foo ""'. [Bug 756951]
	* tests/fCmd.test: added two new tests for the bug.

	* doc/FileSystem.3: documentation fix [Bug 720634]

2003-06-18  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c (Tcl_Export): removed erroneous comments [Bug
	756744]

2003-06-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* tests/regexp.test: fixing of bugs related to regexp and regsub
	matching of empty strings. Addition of a number of new tests.

2003-06-10  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c: let TclEvalObjvInternal call TclInterpReady
	instead of relying on its callers to do so; fix for the part of [Bug
	495830] that is new in 8.4.
	* tests/interp.test: Added tests 18.9 (knownbug) and 18.10

2003-06-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/string.test (string-4.15): Added test for [string first] bug
	reported in Tcl 8.3, where test for all-single-byte-encoded strings
	was not reliable.

2003-06-04  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* tools/man2help.tcl: Added duplicate help section checking and
	* tools/index.tcl:    corrected a comment typo for the getTopics proc
	in index.tcl. [Bug 748700]

2003-05-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c (tclCmdNameType):  Converted internal rep
	management of the cmdName Tcl_ObjType the opposite way, to always use
	the twoPtrValue instead of always using the otherValuePtr. Previous
	fix on 2003-05-12 broke several extensions that wanted to poke around
	with the twoPtrValue.ptr2 value of a cmdName Tcl_Obj, like TclBlend
	and e4graph. [Bug 726018] Thanks to George Petasis for the bug report
	and Jacob Levy for testing assistance.

2003-05-22  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	*** 8.4.3 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c: fixed a problem that caused only the first
	call to Tcl_MacOSXOpenVersionedBundleResources() for a given bundle
	identifier to succeed. This caused the tcl runtime library not to be
	found in all interps created after the inital one.

2003-05-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* changes: updated for 8.4.3

	* unix/Makefile.in: do not run autoconf during 'make dist' as the
	configure is now a CVS-maintained file and should be up-to-date.

2003-05-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: changed tclConfig.sh location in
	versioned framework subdirectories to be identical to location in
	framework toplevel; fixed stub library symbolic links to be Tcl
	version specific.

2003-05-16  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: updated copyright year.

2003-05-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinFile.c (TclpMatchInDirectory): revert glob code to r1.44
	as 2003-04-14 optimizations broke Windows98 glob'ing.

	* README:	    bumped version to 8.4.3
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* unix/configure:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* win/README.binary:
	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in:

	* doc/socket.n: nroff font handling correction.

	* library/encoding/gb2312-raw.enc (new): This is the original
	gb2312.enc renamed to allow for it to still be used. This is needed by
	Tk (unix) because X fonts with gb2312* charsets really do want the
	original gb2312 encoding. [Bug 557030]

2003-05-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Values which can't be
	anything but wide shouldn't be demoted to long. [consequence of HEAD
	fixes for Bug 699060]

2003-05-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/encoding/gb2312.enc: copy euc-cn.enc over original
	gb2312.enc. gb2312.enc appeared to not work as expected, and most uses
	of gb2312 really mean euc-cn (which may be the cause of the problem).
	[Bug 557030]

	* generic/tclEnv.c (TclUnsetEnv): Another putenv() copy behavior
	problem repaired when compiling on windows and using microsoft's
	runtime. [Bug 736421] (gravereaux)

2003-05-13  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: add decl for FsThrExitProc to suppress warnings

2003-05-13  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): Removed unused variable to reduce
	compiler warnings. [Bug 664745]

2003-05-13  Joe Mistachkin  <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* generic/tcl.decls:  Changed Tcl_JoinThread parameter name from "id"
	* generic/tclDecls.h: to "threadId". [Bug 732477]
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:
	* mac/tclMacThrd.c:

2003-05-13  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c: added extended version of the
	Tcl_MacOSXOpenBundleResources() API taking an extra version number
	argument: Tcl_MacOSXOpenVersionedBundleResources(). This is needed to
	be able to access bundle resources in versioned frameworks such as Tcl
	and Tk, otherwise if multiple versions were installed, only the latest
	version's resources could be accessed. [Bug 736774]

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (Tcl_MacOSXGetLibraryPath): use new versioned
	bundle resource API to get tcl runtime library for TCL_VERSION.
	[Bug 736774]

	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: regen.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: worked around the issue of realpath() not being
	thread-safe on Mac OS X by defining NO_REALPATH for threaded builds on
	Mac OS X. [Bug 711232]

2003-05-12  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c: (AliasObjCmd):	Added refCounting of the words
	* tests/interp.test (interp-33.1):	of the target of an interp
	alias during its execution. Also added test. [Bug 730244].

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclInvokeObjectCommand):	objv[argc] is no
	longer set to NULL (Tcl_CreateObjCommand docs already say that it
	should not be accessed).

	* generic/tclObj.c (tclCmdNameType):  Corrected variable use of the
	otherValuePtr or the twoPtrValue.ptr1 fields to store a
	(ResolvedCmdName *) as the internal rep. [Bug 726018].

	* doc/Eval.3:  Corrected prototype for Tcl_GlobalEvalObj [Bug 727622].

2003-05-12  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclObjLookupVar): [Bug 735335] temporary fix,
	disabling usage of tclNsVarNameType.
	* tests/var.test (var-15.1): test for [Bug 735335]

2003-05-10  Zoran Vasiljevic <zoran@archiware.com>

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c: corrected [Bug 723502]

2003-05-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: ensure cd is thread-safe.
	[Bug 710642] (vasiljevic)

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialCloseProc): correct mem leak on closing a
	Windows serial port [Bug 718002] (schroedter)

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): prevent string repeat crash
	when overflow sizes were given (throws error). [Bug 714106]

2003-05-09  Joe Mistachkin <joe@mistachkin.com>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (TclFreeAllocCache): Fixed memory leak
	caused by treating cachePtr as a TLS index [Bug 731754].

	* win/tclAppInit.c (Tcl_AppInit): Fixed memory leaks caused by not
	freeing the memory allocated by setargv and the async handler created
	by Tcl_AppInit. An exit handler has been created that takes care of
	both leaks. In addition, Tcl_AppInit now uses ckalloc instead of
	Tcl_Alloc to allow for easier leak tracking and to be more consistent
	with the rest of the Tcl core [Bugs 733156, 733221].

	* tools/encoding/txt2enc.c (main): Fixed memory leak caused by failing
	to free the memory used by the toUnicode array of strings [Bug 733221]

2003-05-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: The -returnCodes option to [test]
	failed to recognize the symbolic name "ok" for return code 0.

2003-05-05  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_HideCommand): Fixed error message grammar
	and spelling.

2003-04-29  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: fix to bug reported privately by Jeff where,
	for example, 'glob -path {[tcl]} *' gets confused by the leading
	special character (which is escaped internally), and instead lists
	files in '/'. Bug only occurs on Windows where '\' is also a
	directory separator. (Bug has been around at least since Tcl 8.3.)
	* tests/fileName.test: added test for the above bug.

2003-04-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:  Tcl_EvalObjv() failed to honor the
	TCL_EVAL_GLOBAL flag when resolving command names. Tcl_EvalEx passed a
	string rep including leading whitespace and comments to
	TclEvalObjvInternal().

2003-04-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c: Applied [Patch 727271]. This patch changes the
	code to catch any errors returned by the windows functions handling
	TLS ASAP instead of waiting to get some mysterious crash later on due
	to bogus pointers. Patch provided by Joe Mistachkin.

	This is a stop-gap measure to deal with the low number of ?TLS slots
	provided by some of the variants of Windows (60-80).

2003-04-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	When the return code of a test does
	not meet expectations, report that as the reason for test failure,
	and do not attempt to check the test result for correctness. [Bug
	725253]

2003-04-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprCallMathFunc): remove incorrect
	extraneous cast from Tcl_WideAsDouble.

2003-04-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/open.n:		Moved serial port options from [fconfigure]
	* doc/fconfigure.n:	to [open] as it is up to the creator of a
				channel to describe the channel's special
				config options. [Bug 679010]

2003-04-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h		Made changes so that the "wideInt" Tcl_ObjType
	* generic/tclObj.c	is defined on all platforms, even those where
	* generic/tclPort.h	TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG is defined.  Also made
	the Tcl_Value struct have a wideValue field on all platforms.  This is
	a ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY*** for TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG platforms
	because that struct changes size.  This is the same TIP 72
	incompatibility that was seen on other platforms at the 8.4.0 release,
	when this change should have happened as well.	[Bug 713562]

	* generic/tclInt.h:  New internal macros TclGetWide() and
	TclGetLongFromWide() to deal with both forms of the "wideInt"
	Tcl_ObjType, so that conditional TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG code
	is confined to the header file.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:	Replaced most coding that was conditional
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c:	on TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG with code that
	* generic/tclExecute.c: works across platforms, sometimes using
	* generic/tclTest.c:	the new macros above to do it.
	* generic/tclUtil.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c:

2003-04-17  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/socket.n: Added a paragraph to remind people to specify
	their encodings when using sockets. [Bug 630621]

2003-04-16  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/CrtMathFnc.3: Functions also have to deal with wide ints,
	but this was not documented. [Bug 709720]

2003-04-15  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinTime.c: Corrected use of types to make compilation
	compatible with VC++5.

2003-04-14  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: added conditionals to restore compilation on
	VC++6, which was broken by recent changes.

2003-04-14  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	Merged various bug fixes from current cvs head:

	* tests/cmdAH.test: better fix to test suite problem if /home is a
	symlink [Bug 703264]

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix bad error message with 'cd ""' [Bug 704917]
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* win/tclWinInt.h: allow Tcl to differentiate between reparse points
	which are symlinks and mounted volumes, and correctly handle the
	latter. This involves some elaborate code to find the actual drive
	letter (if possible) corresponding to a mounted volume. [Bug 697862]
	* tests/fileSystem.test: add constraints to stop tests running in
	ordinary tcl interpreter. [Bug 705675]
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: Some re-arrangement of code to bring it closer
	to CVS HEAD. No functional changes.

	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: added some filesystem optimisation to the
	'glob' implementation, and some new tests.

	* tests/winFile.test:
	* tests/ioUtil.test:
	* tests/unixFCmd.test: renumbered tests with duplicate numbers. [Bug
	710361]

2003-04-12  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* tests/clock.test: Renumbered test cases to avoid duplicates [Bug
	710310].
	* tests/winTime.test:
	* win/tclWinTest.c (TestwinclockCmd, TestwinsleepCmd):
	* win/tclWinTime.c (Tcl_WinTime, UpdateTimeEachSecond,
	(ResetCounterSamples, AccumulateSample, SAMPLES, TimeInfo): Made
	substantial changes to the phase-locked loop (replaced an IIR filter
	with an FIR one) in a quest for improved loop stability (Bug not
	logged at SF, but cited in private communication from Jeff Hobbs).

2003-04-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd,STR_IS_INT):  Corrected
	inconsistent results of [string is integer] observed on systems
	where sizeof(long) != sizeof(int). [Bug 718878]
	* tests/string.test: Added tests for Bug 718878.
	* doc/string.n: Clarified that [string is integer] accepts
	32-bit integers.

2003-04-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (UpdateInterest): When dropping interest in
	TCL_READABLE now dropping interest in TCL_EXCEPTION too. This fixes a
	bug where Expect detects eof on a file prematurely on Solaris 2.6 and
	higher. A much more complete explanation is in the code itself (40
	lines of comments for a one-line change :)

2003-04-10  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/binary.n: Fixed typo in [binary format w] desc. [Bug 718543]

2003-04-08  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_ErrorObjCmd): Strings are only empty if they
	have zero length, not if their first byte is zero, so fix test
	guarding Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo to take this into account. [Bug reported
	by Don Porter; no bug-id.]

2003-04-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileIfCmd):  Corrected string limits of
	arguments interpolated in error messages. [Bug 711371]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceExecutionProc):  Added missing
	Tcl_DiscardResult() call to avoid memory leak.

2003-04-07  Donal K. Fellows  <zzcgudf@ernie.mvc.mcc.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclObj.c (tclWideIntType, TclInitObjSubsystem):
	(SetBooleanFromAny): Make sure that tclWideIntType is defined and
	somewhat sensible everywhere. [Bug 713562]

2003-04-02  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Set stub lib flag based on new LIBFLAGSUFFIX
	variable.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Set new LIBFLAGSUFFIX that works like
	LIBSUFFIX, it is used when creating library names. The previous
	implementation would generate -ltclstub85 instead of -ltclstub85s when
	configured with --disable-shared.

2003-04-01  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/README: Direct [source] of *.test files is no longer
	recommended. The tests/*.test files should only be evaluated under the
	control of the [runAllTests] command in tests/all.tcl.

2003-03-27  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Added reporting during [configure
	-debug 1] operations to warn about multiple uses of the same test
	name. [FR 576693]  Replaced [regexp] and [regsub] with [string map]
	where possible. Thanks to David Welton. [Bugs 667456,667558]
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl: Bumped to tcltest 2.2.3

	* tests/msgcat.test (msgcat-2.2.1): changed test name to avoid
	duplication. [Bug 710356]

	* unix/dltest/pkg?.c: Changed all Tcl_InitStubs calls to pass argument
	exact = 0, so that rebuilds are not required when Tcl bumps to a new
	version. [Bug 701926]

2003-03-24  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c:
	* tests/var.test: fixing ObjMakeUpvar's lookup algorithm for the
	created local variable, [Bugs 631741] (Chris Darroch) and [696893]
	(David Hilker).

2003-03-22  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl: Fixed a bug where [package require dde] or
	[package require registry] attempted to load the release version of
	the DLL into a debug build. [Bug 708218] Thanks to Joe Mistachkin for
	the patch.
	* win/makefile.vc: Added quoting around the script name in the 'test'
	target; Joe Mistachkin insists that he has a configuration that fails
	to launch tcltest without it, and it appears harmless otherwise.

2003-03-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h (tclOriginalNotifier):
	* generic/tclStubInit.c (tclOriginalNotifier):
	* mac/tclMacNotify.c (Tcl_SetTimer,Tcl_WaitForEvent):
	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c (Tcl_SetTimer,Tcl_WaitForEvent,
	(Tcl_CreateFileHandler,Tcl_DeleteFileHandler):
	* win/tclWinNotify.c (Tcl_SetTimer,Tcl_WaitForEvent): Some linkers
	apparently use a different representation for a pointer to a function
	within the same compilation unit and a pointer to a function in a
	different compilation unit. This causes checks like those in the
	original notifier procedures to fall into infinite loops. The fix is
	to store pointers to the original notifier procedures in a struct
	defined in the same compilation unit as the stubs tables, and compare
	against those values. [Bug 707174]

	* generic/tclInt.h: Removed definition of ParseValue struct that is no
	longer used.

2003-03-19  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* tests/compile.test: bad command count on TCL_OUT_LINE_COMPILE
	[Bug 705406] (Don Porter).

2003-03-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Eval.3 (Tcl_EvalObjEx):			Corrected CONST and
	* doc/ParseCmd.3 (Tcl_EvalTokensStandard):	return type errors in
	documentation. [Bug 683994]

2003-03-18  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/registry.test: Changed the conditionals to avoid an abort if
	[testlocale] is missing, as when running the test in tclsh rather than
	tcltest. [Bug 705677]

2003-03-18  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tools/tcltk-man2html.tcl: added support for building 'make html'
	from inside distribution directories named with 8.x.x version numbers.
	tcltk-man2html now uses the latest tcl8.x.x resp. tk8.x.x directories
	found inside its --srcdir argument.

2003-03-18  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: fix test suite problem if /home is a symlink
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix bad error message with 'cd ""'
	* win/tclWinFile.c: allow Tcl to differentiate between reparse points
	which are symlinks and mounted drives.

	These changes fix [Bugs 703264, 704917, 697862] respectively.

2003-03-17  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lsearch.n:	Altered documentation of -ascii options so
	* doc/lsort.n:		they don't specify that they operate on
				ASCII strings, which they never did
				anyway. [Bug 703807]

2003-03-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FileObjCmd): Remove assumption that file
	times and longs are the same size. [Bug 698146]
	(Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Stop surprising type conversions from
	happening when working with integer and wide values. [Bug 699060]

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Only add the modifier that
	indicates we've got a wide int when we're formatting in an integer
	style. Stops some libc's from going mad. [Bug 702622]
	Also tidied whitespace.

2003-03-13  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc: Backed the version to 8.4 on the 8.4 branch. (I
	just loathe sticky tags).

2003-03-12  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:	Removed TCL_PREFIX_IDENT and TCL_DEBUG_IDENT
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:	from tcl.h -- they are not part of Tcl's
	public interface.  Put them in win/tclWinPipe.c where they are used.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj):	Corrected and added test for
	* tests/subst.test (subst-2.4):		Tcl_SubstObj's incorrect
	halting of substitution at the first \x00 byte. [Bug 685106]

	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_InterpObjCmd):	Corrected and added
	* tests/interp.test (interp-2.13):		test for option
	parsing beyond objc for [interp create --].  Thanks to Marco Maggi.
	[Bug 702383]

2003-03-11  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/makefile.vc: Added two missing uses of $(DBGX) so that
	tclpip8x.dll loads without panicking on Win9x.

2003-03-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:  Added missing "-body" to example.  Thanks to
	Helmut Giese. [Bug 700011]

2003-03-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/TclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharNcasecmp):	Corrected failure to
	* tests/utf.test (utf-25.*):	properly compare Unicode strings of
	different case in a case insensitive manner. [Bug 699042]

2003-03-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4.2 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

2003-03-03  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (TclNewFSPathObj): on TCL_PLATFORM_MAC,
	skip potential directory separator at the beginning of addStrRep.
	* mac/tclMacChan.c (OpenFileChannel, CommonWatch): followup
	fixes to cut and splice implementation for file channels.
	* mac/tclMacFile.c (TclpUtime): pass native path to utime().
	* mac/tclMacFile.c (TclpObjLink): correctly implemented creation
	of alias files via new static proc CreateAliasFile().
	* mac/tclMacPort.h: define S_ISLNK macro to fix stat'ing of links.
	* mac/tclMacUtil.c (FSpLocationFromPathAlias): fix to enable
	stat'ing of broken links.

2003-03-03  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/Makefile.vc: corrected bug introduced by 'g' for debug builds.

2003-03-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/opt/pkgIndex.tcl:	updated package index to version 0.4.4

2003-02-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: check for 'g' for debug build type, not 'd'.
	* win/rules.vc (DBGX): correct to use 'g' for nmake win makefile
	to match the cygwin makefile for debug builds. [Bug 635107]

2003-02-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n: subcommand is 'file volumes' not 'file volume'

2003-02-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (MakeFsPathFromRelative): removed dead code
	check of typePtr (darley).

	* tests/winTime.test: added note about PCI hardware dependency
	issues with high performance clock.

2003-02-27  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/lsearch.test (lsearch-10.7):
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsearchObjCmd): Stopped -start option from
	causing an option when used with an empty list. [Bug 694232]

2003-02-26  Chengye Mao <chengye.geo@yahoo.com>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: fixed a bug in TclpSetVariables by initializing
	dwUserNameLen with the sizeof(szUserName) before calling GetUserName.
	Don't know if this bug has been recorded: it caused crash in starting
	Tcl or wish in Windows.

2003-02-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceCommandProc): Fix mem leak when
	deleting a command that had trace on it. [Bug 693564] (sofer)

2003-02-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/pkgMkIndex.n:	Modified [pkg_mkIndex] to use -nocase matching
	* library/package.tcl:	of -load patterns, to better accomodate
	common user errors due to confusion between [package names] names
	and [info loaded] names.

2003-02-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* tests/pid.test: See below [Bug 678412].
	* tests/io.test: Made more robust against spaces in paths [Bug 678400]

2003-02-25  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* tests/execute.test: cleaning up testobj's at the end, to avoid leak
	warning by valgrind.

2003-02-22  Zoran Vasiljevic  <zoran@archiwrae.com>

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_FinalizeThread): Fix [Bug 571002]

2003-02-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/binary.test (binary-44.[34]):
	* generic/tclBinary.c (ScanNumber): Fixed problem with unwanted
	sign-bit propagation when scanning wide ints. [Bug 690774]

2003-02-21  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacChan.c (TclpCutFileChannel, TclpSpliceFileChannel):
	Implemented missing cut and splice procs for file channels.

2003-02-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl (tclPkgUnknown):	Minor performance tweaks to
	reduce the number of [file] invocations. Meant to improve startup
	times, at least a little bit. [Patch 687906]

2003-02-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c: (macosx) use vfork() instead of fork() to create
	new processes, as recommended by Apple (vfork can be up to 100 times
	faster thank fork on macosx).
	* unix/configure: regen.

2003-02-20  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (LoadTableEncoding):
	* library/encoding/cp932.enc:	   Correct jis round-trip encoding
	* library/encoding/euc-jp.enc:	   by adding 'R' type to .enc files.
	* library/encoding/iso2022-jp.enc: [Patch 689341] (koboyasi, taguchi)
	* library/encoding/jis0208.enc:
	* library/encoding/shiftjis.enc:
	* tests/encoding.test:

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (Tcl_MakeTcpClientChannel): add
	MakeTcpClientChannelMode that takes actual mode flags to avoid
	hang on OS X (may be OS X bug, but patch works x-plat).
	[Bug 689835] (steffen)

2003-02-20  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/regsub.n: Typo fix [Bug 688943]

2003-02-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpReaddir):
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: update to Bug 689100 patch to ensure that
	there is a defined value of MAXNAMLEN (aka NAME_MAX in POSIX) and
	that we have some buffer allocated.

2003-02-19  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c: restored Tcl_SetObjLength() side-effect of
	always invalidating unicode rep (if the obj has a string rep). Added
	hasUnicode flag to String struct, allows decoupling of validity of
	unicode rep from buffer size allocated to it (improves memory
	allocation efficiency). [Bugs 686782, 671138, 635200]

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	* macosx/Makefile: reworked embedded build to no longer require
	relinking but to use install_name_tool instead to change the
	install_names for embedded frameworks. [Bug 644510]

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: preserve mod dates when running
	'make install' to build framework (avoids bogus rebuilds of dependent
	frameworks because tcl headers appear changed).

	* tests/ioCmd.test (iocmd-1.8): fix failure when system encoding is
	utf-8: use iso8859-1 encoding explicitly.

2003-02-18  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileExprWords): remove unused variable
	"range" [Bug 664743]
	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprSrandFunc): remove unused variable
	"result" [Bug 664743]
	* generic/tclStringObj.c (UpdateStringOfString): remove unused
	variable "length" [Bug 664751]
	* tests/execute.test (execute-7.30): fix for [Bug 664775]

2003-02-18  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* unix/tcl.m4: [Bug 651811] Added definition of _XOPEN_SOURCE and
	linkage of 'xnet' library to HP 11 branch. This kills a lot of
	socket-related failures in the testsuite when Tcl was compiled in 64
	bit mode (both PA-RISC 2.0W, and IA 64).

	* unix/configure: Regenerated.

2003-02-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIO.c (HaveVersion): correctly decl static

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpReaddir): reduce size of name string in
	tsd to NAME_MAX instead of PATH_MAX. [Bug 689100] (waters)

2003-02-18  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_THREADS): Make sure -lpthread gets passed on
	the link line when checking for the pthread_attr_setstacksize symbol.

2003-02-18  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c: cleanup of new 'simplefs' test code, and better
	documentation.

2003-02-17  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclRenameCommand): fixing error in previous
	commit.

2003-02-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode INST_STR_MATCH):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd STR_MATCH):
	* generic/tclUtf.c (TclUniCharMatch):
	* generic/tclInt.decls:	 add private TclUniCharMatch function that
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: does string match on counted unicode
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: strings.  Tcl_UniCharCaseMatch has the
	* tests/string.test:	 failing that it can't handle strings or
	* tests/stringComp.test: patterns with embedded NULLs.	Added
	tests that actually try strings/pats with NULLs.  TclUniCharMatch
	should be TIPed and made public in the next minor version rev.

2003-02-17  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclRenameCommand): 'oldFullName' object was not
	being freed on all function exits, causing a memory leak. [Bug 684756]

2003-02-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_GetsObj): Minor change so that eol is only
	assigned at the top of the TCL_TRANSLATE_AUTO case block. The other
	cases assign eol so this does not change any functionality.

2003-02-17  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/notify.test: Removed Windows line terminators. [Bug 687913].

2003-02-15  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx):
	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (CompileSubExpr):
	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileScript):

	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (ParsePrimaryExpr):
	* tests/basic.test (47.1):
	* tests/main.test (3.4):
	* tests/misc.test (1.2):
	* tests/parse.test (6.18):
	* tests/parseExpr.test (15.35):
	* tests/subst.test (8.6): Don Porter's fix for bad parsing of
	nested scripts [Bug 681841].

2003-02-15  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/notify.test (new-file):
	* generic/tclTest.c (TclTest_Init, EventtestObjCmd, EventtestProc,
	(EventTestDeleteProc):
	* generic/tclNotify.c (Tcl_DeleteEvents): Fixed Tcl_DeleteEvents
	not to get a pointer smash when deleting the last event in the
	queue. Added test code in 'tcltest' and a new file of test cases
	'notify.test' to exercise this functionality; several of the new
	test cases fail for the original code and pass for the corrected
	code. [Bug 673714]

	* unix/tclUnixTest.c (TestfilehandlerCmd): Corrected a couple
	of typos in error messages. [Bug 596027]

2003-02-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:		Bumped to version 8.4.2.
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* unix/configure:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* win/README.binary:
	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in:
	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj:

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_GetCharLength): perf tweak

	* unix/tcl.m4: correct HP-UX ia64 --enable-64bit build flags

2003-02-14  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinTime.c: Added code to test and compensate for forward
	leaps of the performance counter. See the MSDN Knowledge Base article
	Q274323 for the hardware problem that makes this necessary on certain
	machines.
	* tests/winTime.test: Revised winTime-2.1 - it had a tolerance of
	thousands of seconds, rather than milliseconds. (What's six orders of
	magnitude among friends?

	Both the above changes are triggered by a problem reported at
	http://aspn.activestate.com/ASPN/Mail/Message/ActiveTcl/1536811
	although the developers find it difficult to believe that it accounts
	for the observed behavior and suspect a fault in the RTC chip.

2003-02-13  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinInit.c: Added conversion from the system encoding to
	tcl_platform(user), so that it works with non-ASCII7 user names. [Bug
	685926]

	* doc/tclsh.1: Added language to describe the handling of the
	end-of-file character \u001a embedded in a script file. [Bug 685485]

2003-02-11  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileName.test:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: fix for [Bug 685445] when using 'glob -l' on
	broken symbolic links. Added two new tests for this bug.

2003-02-11  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/http.test: Corrected a problem where http-4.14 would fail when
	run in an environment with a proxy server. Replaced references to
	scriptics.com by tcl.tk.

2003-02-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/lsearch.test:
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (Tcl_LsearchObjCmd): protect against the case
	that lsearch -regepx list and pattern objects are equal.

	* tests/stringObj.test:
	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_GetCharLength): correct ascii char
	opt of 2002-11-11 to not stop early on \x00. [Bug 684699]

	* tests.parse.test: remove excess EOF whitespace

	* generic/tclParse.c (CommandComplete): more paranoid check to
	break on (p >= end) instead of just (p == end).

2003-02-11  Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sf.net>

	* generic/tclParse.c (CommandComplete):
	* tests/parse.test: fix for [Bug 684744], by Don Porter.

2003-02-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSJoinPath, Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath):
	(UpdateStringOfFsPath): revert the cwdLen == 0 check and instead
	follow a different code path in Tcl_FSJoinPath.
	(Tcl_FSConvertToPathType, Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath):
	(Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath): Update string rep of path objects
	before freeing the internal object. (darley)

	* tests/fileSystem.test: added test 8.3
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSGetNormalizedPath):
	(UpdateStringOfFsPath): handle the cwdLen == 0 case

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c (TclpMatchInDirectory): simplify the hidden
	file match check.

2003-02-10  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: Generate error when attempting to build under
	Cygwin. The Cygwin port of Tcl/Tk does not build and people are filing
	bug reports under the mistaken impression that someone is actually
	maintaining the Cygwin port. A post to comp.lang.tcl asking someone to
	volunteer as an area maintainer has generated no results. Closing
	[Bugs 680840, 630199, 634772] and marking as "Won't fix".

2003-02-10  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/append.n: Return value was not documented. [Bug 683188]

2003-02-10  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: further filesystem optimization, applying
	[Patch 682500]. In particular, these code examples are faster now:
	    foreach f $flist { if {[file exists $f]} {file stat $f arr;...}}
	    foreach f [glob -dir $dir *] { # action and/or recursion on $f }
	    cd $dir
	    foreach f [glob *] { # action and/or recursion on $f }
	    cd ..

	* generic/tclTest.c: Fix for [Bug 683181] where test suite left files
	in 'tmp'.

2003-02-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/safe.tcl: code cleanup of eval and string comp use.

2003-02-07  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: cleanup long lines
	* win/tclWinFile.c: sped up pure 'glob' by a factor of 2.5 ('foreach f
	[glob *] { file exists $f }' is still slow)
	* tests/fileSystem.text:
	* tests/fileName.test: added new tests to ensure correct behaviour in
	optimized filesystem code.

2003-02-07  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* tests/fileSystem.text: fixed test 7.2 to avoid a possible crash, and
	not change the pwd.

	* tests/http.text: added comment to test 4.15, that it may fail if you
	use a proxy server.

2003-02-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileIncrCmd):
	* tests/incr.test: Don't include the text "(increment expression)" in
	the errorInfo generated by the compiled version of the incr command
	since it does not match the message generated by the non-compiled
	version of incr. It is also not possible to match this error output
	under Jacl, which does not support a compiler.

2003-02-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): When an error is
	encountered reading the increment value during a compiled call to
	incr, add a "(reading increment)" error string to the errorInfo
	variable. This makes the errorInfo variable set by the compiled incr
	command match the value set by the non-compiled version.
	* tests/incr-old.test: Change errorInfo result for the compiled incr
	command case to match the modified implementation.
	* tests/incr.test: Add tests to make sure the compiled and
	non-compiled errorInfo messages are the same.

2003-02-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Filename arguments to [outputChannel]
	and [errorChannel] (also -outfile and -errfile) were [open]ed but
	never [closed]. Also, [cleanupTests] could remove output or error
	files. [Bug 676978].
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl: Bumped to version 2.2.2.

2003-02-05  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/interp.test:
	* tests/set-old.test: Run test cases that depend on hash order through
	lsort so that the tests also pass under Jacl. Does not change test
	results under Tcl.

2003-02-04  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWinInit.c:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* tests/fileSystem.test: fix to finalization/unloading/encoding issues
	to make filesystem much less dependent on encodings for its cleanup,
	and therefore allow it to be finalized later in the exit process. This
	fixes fileSystem.test-7.1. Also fixed one more bug in setting of
	modification dates of files which have undergone cross-platform
	copies. [Patch 676271]

	* tests/basic.test:
	* tests/exec.test:
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/io.test: fixed some test failures when tests are run from a
	directory containing spaces.

	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* generic/tclTest.c: added regression test for the modification
	date setting of cross-platform file copies.

2003-02-03  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c: Changed [trace add command] so that 'rename'
	callbacks get fully qualified names of the command. [Bug 651271].
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***
	* tests/trace.test: Modified the test cases for [trace add command] to
	expect fully qualified names on the 'rename' callbacks. Added a case
	for renaming a proc within a namespace.
	* doc/trace.n: Added language about use of fully qualified names in
	trace callbacks.

2003-02-01  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: Removed an unused variable that caused
	compiler warnings on SGI. [Bug 664379]

	* generic/tclLoad.c: Changed the code so that if Tcl_StaticPackage is
	called to report the same package as being loaded in two interps, it
	shows up in [info loaded {}] in both of them (previously, it didn't
	appear in the static package list in the second.

	* tests/load.test Added regression test for the above bug. [Bug
	670042]

	* generic/tclClock.c: Fixed a bug that incorrectly allowed [clock
	clicks {}] and [clock clicks -] to be accepted as if they were [clock
	clicks -milliseconds].

	* tests/clock.test: Added regression tests for the above bug. [Bug
	675356]

	* tests/unixNotfy.test: Added cleanup of working files [Bug 675609]

	* doc/Tcl.n: Added headings to the eleven paragraphs, to improve
	formatting in the tools that attempt to extract tables of contents
	from the manual pages. [Bug 627455]

	* generic/tclClock.c: Expanded mutex protection around the setting of
	env(TZ) and the thread-unsafe call to tzset(). [Bug 656660]

2003-01-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test: Cleaned up management of file/directory
	creation/deletion to improve "-debug 1" output. [Bug 675614] The
	utility [slave] command failed to properly [list]-quote a constructed
	[open] command, causing failure when the pathname contained
	whitespace. [Bug 678415]

	* tests/main.test: Stopped main.test from deleting existing file.
	Test suite should not delete files that already exist. [Bug 675660]

2003-01-28  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/main.test: Constrain tests that do not work on Windows. [Bug
	674387]

2003-01-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to setting modification date in
	TclCrossFilesystemCopy. Also added 'panic' in
	Tcl_FSGetFileSystemForPath under illegal calling circumstances which
	lead to hard-to-track-down bugs.

	* generic/tclTest.c: added test suite code to allow exercising a
	vfs-crash-on-exit bug in Tcl's finalization caused by the encodings
	being cleaned up before unloading occurs.
	* tests/fileSystem.test: added new 'knownBug' test 7.1 to demonstrate
	the crash on exit.

2003-01-28  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Add TCL_PREFIX_IDENT and TCL_DEBUG_IDENT, used only
	by TclpCreateProcess.
	* unix/Makefile.in: Define TCL_DBGX.
	* win/Makefile.in: Define TCL_DBGX.
	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclpCreateProcess): Check that the Tcl pipe dll
	actually exists in the Tcl bin directory and panic if it is not
	found. Incorporate TCL_DBGX into the Tcl pipe dll name. This fixes a
	really mysterious error that would show up when exec'ing a 16 bit
	application under Win95 or Win98 when Tcl was compiled with symbols.
	The error seemed to indicate that the executable could not be found,
	but it was actually the Tcl pipe dll that could not be found.

2003-01-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update msys+mingw URL to release 6. This version bundles
	gcc 3.

2003-01-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Add test that checks to see if the compiler can
	cast to a union type.
	* win/tclWinTime.c: Squelch compiler warning about union initializer
	by casting to union type when compiling with gcc.

2003-01-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_CutChannel, Tcl_SpliceChannel): Invoke
	TclpCutFileChannel and TclpSpliceFileChannel.
	* generic/tclInt.h: Declare TclpCutFileChannel and
	TclpSpliceFileChannel.
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (FileCloseProc, TclpOpenFileChannel,
	(Tcl_MakeFileChannel, TclpCutFileChannel,
	(TclpSpliceFileChannel): Implement thread load data cut and splice for
	file channels. This avoids an invalid memory ref when compiled with
	-DDEPRECATED.
	* win/tclWinChan.c (FileCloseProc, TclpCutFileChannel,
	(TclpSpliceFileChannel): Implement thread load data cut and splice for
	file channels. This avoids an invalid memory ref that was showing up
	in the thread extension.

2003-01-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace, squelch_warnings):
	* win/tclWinChan.c (Tcl_MakeFileChannel, squelch_warnings):
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, DoCopyFile, squelch_warnings):
	Re-implement inline ASM SEH handlers for gcc. The esp and ebp
	registers are now saved on the stack instead of in global variables so
	that the code is thread safe. Add additional checks when TCL_MEM_DEBUG
	is defined to be sure the values were recovered from the stack
	properly. Remove squelch_warnings functions and add a dummy call in
	the handler methods to squelch compiler warnings.

2003-01-25  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: Define HAVE_ALLOCA_GCC_INLINE when we detect that
	no alloca function is found in malloc.h and we are compiling with
	GCC. Remove HAVE_NO_ALLOC_DECL define.
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace): Don't define alloca as a
	cdecl function. Doing this caused a tricky runtime bug because the
	_alloca function expects the size argument to be passed in a register
	and not on the stack. To fix this problem, we use inline ASM when
	compiling with gcc to invoke _alloca with the size argument loaded
	into a register.

2003-01-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinDde.c (Dde_Init): clarified use of tsdPtr.
	(DdeServerProc): better refcount handling of returnPackagePtr.

	* generic/tclEvent.c (Tcl_Finalize): revert finalize change on
	2002-12-04 to correct the issue with extensions that have TSD needing
	to finalize that before they are unloaded. This issue needs further
	clarification.

	* tests/unixFCmd.test: only do groups check on unix

2003-01-24  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c: proper fixes for Tcl_SetObjLength and
	Tcl_AttemptSetObjectLength dealing with string objects with both
	pure-unicode and normal internal representations. Previous fix didn't
	handle all cases correctly.
	* generic/tclIO.c: Add 'Tcl_GetString()' to ensure the object has a
	valid 'objPtr->bytes' field before manipulating it directly.

	This fixes [Bug 635200] and [Bug 671138], but may reduce performance
	of Unicode string handling in some cases. A further patch will be
	applied to address this, once the code is known to be correct.

2003-01-24  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Add test to see if alloca is undefined in
	malloc.h.
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace): Rework the SEH exception
	handler logic to avoid using the stack since alloca will modify the
	stack. This was causing a nasty bug that would set the exception
	handler to 0 because it tried to pop the previous exception handler
	off the top of the stack.

2003-01-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lset.n: Fixed fault in return values from lset in documentation
	examples [Bug 658463] and tidied up a bit at the same time.

2003-01-21  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>
	* doc/namespace.n (namespace inscope): Clarified documentation
	[Patch 670110]

2003-01-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Set SHLIB_SUFFIX so that
	TCL_SHLIB_SUFFIX will be set to a useful value in the generated
	tclConfig.sh. Set SHLIB_LD_LIBS to "" or '${LIBS}' based on the
	--enable-shared flag. This matches the UNIX implementation.

2003-01-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c: change %ud to %u as appropriate.

2003-01-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinDde.c (DdeServerProc): Deallocate the Tcl_Obj returned by
	ExecuteRemoteObject if it was not saved in a connection object.

2003-01-17  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Revert earlier change that defined TCL_WIDE_INT_TYPE
	as long long and TCL_LL_MODIFIER as L when compiling with mingw. This
	change ended up causing some test case failures when compiling with
	mingw.
	* generic/tclObj.c (UpdateStringOfWideInt): Describe the warning
	generated by mingw and why it needs to be ignored so that someone is
	not tempted to "fix" this problem again in the future.

2003-01-16  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclStringObj.c: Tcl_SetObjLength fix for when the object has
	a unicode string rep. Fixes [Bug 635200]
	* tests/stringObj.test: removed 'knownBug' constraint from test 14.1
	now that this bug is fixed.

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.z:
	* tests/trace.test: execution and command tracing bug fixes and
	cleanup. In particular fixed [Bugs 655645, 615043, 571385]
	  - fixed some subtle cleanup problems with tracing. This required
	    replacing Tcl_Preserve/Tcl_Release with a more robust refCount
	    approach. Solves at least one known crash caused by memory
	    corruption.
	  - fixed some confusion in the code between new style traces (Tcl
	    8.4) and the very limited 'Tcl_CreateTrace' which existed before.
	  - made behaviour consistent with documentation (several tests even
	    contradicted the documentation before).
	  - fixed some minor error message details
	  - added a number of new tests

2003-01-16  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialOutputProc): add casts for bytesWritten to
	allow strict compilation (no warnings).

	* tests/winDde.test:
	* win/tclWinDde.c (Tcl_DdeObjCmd): Prevent crash when empty service
	name is passed to 'dde eval' and goto errorNoResult in request and
	poke error cases to free up any allocated data.

2003-01-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (squelch_warnings): Squelch compiler warnings from
	SEH ASM code.
	* win/tclWinChan.c (squelch_warnings): Squelch compiler warnings from
	SEH ASM code.
	* win/tclWinDde.c: Add casts to avoid compiler warnings. Pass pointer
	to DWORD instead of int to avoid compiler warnings.
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (squelch_warnings): Add casts and fixup decls to
	avoid compiler warnings. Squelch compiler warnings from SEH ASM code.
	* win/tclWinFile.c: Add casts and fixup decls to avoid compiler
	warnings. Remove unused variable.
	* win/tclWinNotify.c: Declare as DWORD instead of int to avoid
	compiler warning.
	* win/tclWinReg.c: Add casts to avoid compiler warning. Fix assignment
	in if expression bug.
	* win/tclWinSerial.c: Add casts to avoid compiler warnings. Remove
	unused variable.
	* win/tclWinSock.c: Add casts and fixup decls to avoid compiler
	warnings.

2003-01-14  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclClock.c (FormatClock): corrected typo that incorrectly
	conditionally defined savedTZEnv and savedTimeZone.

2003-01-13  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	Fix mingw build problems and compiler warnings.

	* generic/tcl.h: Add if defined(__MINGW32__) check to code that sets
	the TCL_WIDE_INT_TYPE and TCL_LL_MODIFIER.
	* generic/tclClock.c (FormatClock): Don't define savedTimeZone and
	savedTZEnv if we are not going to use them.
	* generic/tclEnv.c: Add cast to avoid warning.
	* win/tclWinChan.c: Use DWORD instead of int to avoid compiler warning
	* win/tclWinThrd.c: Only define allocLock, allocLockPtr, and dataKey
	when TCL_THREADS is defined. This avoid a compiler warning about
	unused variables.

2003-01-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update msys + mingw URL, the new release includes the
	released 1.0.8 version of msys which includes a number of bug fixes.

2003-01-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Pull in addition of shell32.lib to
	LIBS_GUI that was added to the Tk tcl.m4 but never made it back into
	the Tcl version.

2003-01-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: Skip Tcl's define of CHAR, SHORT, and LONG when
	HAVE_WINNT_IGNORE_VOID is defined. This avoids a bunch of compiler
	warnings when building with Cygwin or Mingw.
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Define HAVE_WINNT_IGNORE_VOID when we detect a
	winnt.h that still defines CHAR, SHORT, and LONG when VOID has already
	been defined.
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_LOAD_TCLCONFIG): Subst the TCL_DEFS loaded from
	tclConfig.sh so that Tcl defines can make it into the Tk Makefile.

2003-01-12  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Check for typedefs like LPFN_ACCEPT in winsock2.h
	and define HAVE_NO_LPFN_DECLS if not found.
	* win/tclWinSock.c: Define LPFN_* typedefs if HAVE_NO_LPFN_DECLS is
	defined. This fixes the build under Mingw and Cygwin, it was broken by
	the changes made on 2002-11-26.

2003-01-10  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWinInit.c: fix to new WinTcl crash on exit with vfs,
	introduced on 2002-12-06. Encodings must be cleaned up after the
	filesystem.

	* win/makefile.vc: fix to minor VC++ 5.2 syntax problem

2003-01-09  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompilerReturnCmd): Corrected off-by-one
	problem with recent commit. [Bug 633204]

2003-01-09  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: remove unused variable 'macSpecialCase' [Bug
	664749]

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* tests/cmdAH.test: fix to non-ascii chars in paths when setting mtime
	and atime through 'file (a|m)time $path $time'. [Bug 634151]

2003-01-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExprFloatError): Use the IS_NAN macro for
	greater clarity of code.

2003-01-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileReturnCmd):
	* tests/compile.test:	Corrects failure of bytecompiled [catch
	{return}] to have result TCL_RETURN (not TCL_OK) [Bug 633204]. This
	patch is a workaround for 8.4.X. A new opcode INST_RETURN is a better
	long term solution for 8.5 and later.

2003-01-04  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc: Fixed INSTALLDIR macro problem that blanked itself by
	accident causing the install target to put the tree at the root of the
	drive built on. Whoops..

	Renamed the 'linkexten' option to be 'staticpkg'. Added 'thrdalloc' to
	allow the switching _on_ of the thread allocator. Under testing, I
	found it not to be benificial under windows for the purpose of the
	application I was using it for. It was more important for this app
	that resources for tcl threads be returned to the system rather than
	saved/moved to the global recycler. Be extra clean or extra fast for
	the default threaded build? Let's move to clean and allow it to be
	switched on for users who find it benificial for their use of threads.

2002-12-18  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: some uses of xcopy swapped to the @$(CPY) macro.
	Reported by Joe Mistachkin <joe@mistachkin.com>.

2002-12-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclNotify.c (TclFinalizeNotifier, Tcl_SetServiceMode):
	(Tcl_ThreadAlert): Check that the stub functions are non-NULL before
	calling them. They could be set to NULL by Tcl_SetNotifier.

2002-12-16  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclPipe.c (TclCleanupChildren):
	* tests/winPipe.test:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c (Tcl_WaitPid):
	* win/tclWinTest.c:  Gave Tcl_WaitPid the ability to return a Win32
	exception code translated into a posix style SIG*. This allows [close]
	to report "CHILDKILLED" without the meaning getting lost in a
	truncated exit code. In TclCleanupChildren(), TclpGetPid() had to get
	moved to before Tcl_WaitPid() as the the handle is removed from the
	list taking away the ability to get the process id after the wait is
	done. This shouldn't effect the unix implimentaion unless waitpid is
	called with a pid of zero, meaning "any". I don't think it is..

2002-12-13  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure.in:	Updated configure of CVS snapshots to reflect
	* win/configure.in:	the 8.4.1.1 patchlevel.

	* unix/configure:	autoconf
	* win/configure		autoconf

2002-12-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c (ProcessProcResultCode): Fix failure to propagate
	negative return codes up the call stack. [Bug 647307]
	* tests/proc.test (proc-6.1): Test for Bug 647307

	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (TclParseInteger):  Return 1 for the
	string "0x" (recognize leading "0" as an integer). [Bug 648441].
	* tests/parseExpr.test (parseExpr-19.1): Test for Bug 648441.

2002-12-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (TclpMasterUnlock):
	* generic/tclThread.c (TclFinalizeThreadData): TclpMasterUnlock must
	exist and be called unconditional of TCL_THREADS. [Bug 651139]

2002-12-08  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinSock.c (SocketThreadExitHandler, InitSockets):  Check that
	the tsdPtr is valid before dereferencing as we call it from the exit
	handler, too [Bug 650353]. Another WSAStartup() loaded version
	comparison byte swap issue fixed. Although 0x0101 byte swapped is
	still 0x0101, properly claiming which is major/minor is more correct.

2002-12-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclStubInit.c: regen
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h: regen
	* generic/tclInt.decls: added TclWinResetInterface

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclWinResetInterfaces):
	* win/tclWinInit.c (TclpSetInitialEncodings, WinEncodingsCleanup):
	add exit handler that resets the encoding information to a state where
	we can reuse Tcl. Following these changes, it is possible to reuse Tcl
	(following Tcl_FindExecutable or Tcl_CreateInterp) following a
	Tcl_Finalize.

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (TclFinalizeFilesystem): reset statics to their
	original values on finalize to allow reuse of the library.

2002-12-04  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c: reverted back to -r1.27 due to numerous test
	failures that need to be resolved first. The idea was good, but the
	details aren't.

2002-12-04  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (Tcl_WaitPid): When a process exits with an
	exception, pass this notice on to the caller with a SIG* code rather
	than truncating the exit code and missing the meaning.  This allows
	TclCleanupChildren() to report "CHILDKILLED".

	This has a different behavior than unix in that closing the read pipe
	to a process sends the SIGPIPE signal which is returned as a SIGPIPE
	exit status.  On windows, we send the process a CTRL_BREAK_EVENT and
	get back a CONTROL_C_EXIT which is documented to mean a SIGINT which
	seems wrong as a system, but is the correct exit status.

2002-12-04  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to redirected 'load' in virtual filesystem
	for some Unix systems.

	* generic/tclEvent.c: the filesystem must be cleaned up before the
	encoding subsystem because it needs access to encodings. Fixes crash
	on exit observed in embedded applications.

	* generic/tclTestObj.c: patch omitted from previous change of
	2002-11-13

2002-12-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclStubLib.c (Tcl_InitStubs): prevent the cached check of
	tclStubsPtr to allow for repeated load/unload of the Tcl dll by
	hosting apps. [Bug 615304]

2002-12-03  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclAppInit.c (sigHandler): Protect from trying to close a NULL
	handle.

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (PipeClose2Proc, TclpCreateProcess): Send a real
	Win32 signal (CTRL_C_EVENT) when the read channel is brought down to
	alert the child to close on its side. Start the process with
	CREATE_NEW_PROCESS_GROUP to allow the ability to send these signals.
	The following test case now brings down the child without the use of
	an external [kill] command.

		% set p [open "|[info name]" w+]
		file8d5380
		% pid $p
		2876
		% close $p     <- now doesn't block in Tcl_WaitPid()
		%

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (PipeClose2Proc): Changed CTRL_C_EVENT to
	CTRL_BREAK_EVENT as it can't be ignored by the child and proved to
	work on [open "|netstat 1" w+] where CTRL_C_EVENT didn't.

2002-11-27  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPort.h: Don't turn off winsock prototypes! TclX didn't
	like it. Even though the core doesn't use the prototypes, do offer
	them.

	* win/tclWinSock.c: Removed shutdown() from the function table as it
	wasn't referenced anywhere and cleaned-up some casting that that
	wasn't needed.

	* win/tclWinSock.c: WSAStartup() loaded version comparison error which
	resulted in 2.0 looking less than 1.1.

	* win/tclWinChan.c (Tcl_MakeFileChannel): return of DuplicateHandle()
	incorrectly used [Bug 618852].

2002-11-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (TclFinalizeEncodingSubsystem): properly
	cleanup all encodings by using Tcl_FirstHashEntry in the while loop.

	* unix/Makefile.in (valgrind): add simple valgrind target

	* tests/exec.test: unset path var to allow singleproc testing

	* generic/tclInterp.c (AliasCreate): preserve/release interps to
	prevent possible FMR error in bad alias cases.

2002-11-26  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinPort.h:
	* win/tclWinSock.c:  This patch does two things:

	1) Cleans-up the winsock typedefs by using the typedefs provided by
	winsock2.h. This has no effect on how winsock is initialized; just
	makes the source code easier to read. [Patch 561305, 561301]

	2) Revamps how the socket message handler thread is brought up and
	down to allow for cleaner exits without the use of TerminateThread().
	TerminateThread is evil. No attempt has been made to resolve [Bug
	593810] which may need a new channel driver version for adding a
	registering function within the transfered thread to init the handler
	thread. IOW, initialization of the TSD structure is getting bypassed
	through the thread extension's [thread::transfer] command.

2002-11-26  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinConsole.c:
	* win/tclWinPipe.c:
	* win/tclWinSerial.c:
	* win/tclWinSock.c:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c:
	* win/tclWinTime.c: General cleanup of all worker threads used by the
	channel drivers. Eliminates the normal case where the worker thread is
	terminated ('cept the winsock one). Instead, use kernel events to
	signal a clean exit. Only when the worker thread is blocked on an I/O
	call is the thread terminated. Essentially, this makes all other
	channel worker threads behave like the PipeReaderThread() function for
	it's cleaner exit behavior. This appears to fix [Bug 597924] but needs
	3rd party confirmation to close the issue.

2002-11-26  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update msys build env URL. This release #4 build both
	tcl and tk without problems.

2002-11-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/init.tcl:	    code cleanup to reduce use of
	* library/opt/optparse.tcl: string compare

	* tests/interp.test: interp-14.4
	* generic/tclInterp.c (TclPreventAliasLoop): prevent seg fault when
	creating an alias command over the interp name. [Bug 641195]

2002-11-18  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (SetEndOffsetFromAny): handle integer offset
	after the "end-" prefix.

	* generic/get.test:
	* generic/string.test:
	* generic/tclObj.c (SetIntFromAny, SetWideIntFromAny):
	* generic/tclGet.c (TclGetLong, Tcl_GetInt): simplify sign handling
	before calling strtoul(l). [Bug 634856]

2002-11-18  David Gravereaux  <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (Tcl_CreateThread/TclpThreadExit): Fixed improper
	compiler macros that missed the VC++ compiler. This resulted in VC++
	builds using CreateThread()/ExitThread() in place of the proper
	_beginthreadex()/_endthreadex(). This was a large error and am
	surprised I missed seeing it earlier.

2002-11-13  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/regexpComp.test: added tests 22.*
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileRegexpCmd): add left and right
	anchoring (^ and $) recognition and check starting or ending .* to
	extend the number of REs that can be compiled to string match or
	string equal.

2002-11-13  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* tests/trace.test: applied patch from Hemang Levana to fix [Bug
	615043] in execution traces with 'return -code error'.

	* generic/tclTestObj.c:
	* tests/stringObj.test: added 'knownBug' test for [Bug 635200]
	* generic/tclStringObj.c: corrected typos in comments

	* generic/tclFileName.c:
	* tests/fileName.test: applied patch for bug reported against tclvfs
	concerning handling of Windows serial ports like 'com1', 'lpt3' by the
	virtual filesystem code.

	* doc/RegExp.3: clarification of the 'extendMatch' return values.

2002-11-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_Backslash): use TclUtfToUniChar.
	(Tcl_StringCaseMatch): use TclUtfToUniChar and add further
	optimizations for the one-byte/char case.

	* generic/tclUtf.c: make use of TclUtfToUniChar macro throughout the
	functions, and add extra optimization to Tcl_NumUtfChars for
	one-byte/char case.

	* generic/tclVar.c (DisposeTraceResult, CallVarTraces): add proper
	static declarations.

	* generic/tclStringObj.c (Tcl_GetCharLength): optimize for the ascii
	char case.
	(Tcl_GetUniChar): remove unnecessary use of Tcl_UtfToUniChar.
	(FillUnicodeRep): Use TclUtfToUniChar.

	* generic/tclHash.c (HashStringKey): move string++ lower to save an
	instruction.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): improve INST_STR_CMP to
	use memcmp in the one-byte/char case, also use direct index for
	INST_STR_INDEX in that case.

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (UtfToUtfProc, UtfToUnicodeProc):
	(TableFromUtfProc, EscapeFromUtfProc): Use TclUtfToUniChar.
	(UnicodeToUtfProc, TableToUtfProc): add 1-byte char optimizations
	for Tcl_UniCharToUtf call. These improve encoded channel conversion
	speeds by up to 20%.

	* tests/split.test: added 1-char string split tests
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SplitObjCmd): Use TclUtfToUniChar. Also
	added a special case for single-ascii-char splits.
	(Tcl_StringObjCmd): Use TclUtfToUniChar. For STR_RANGE, support
	getting ranges of ByteArrays (reverts change from 2000-05-26).
	(TraceExecutionProc) add proper static declaration.

	* generic/tclInt.h: add macro version of Tcl_UtfToUniChar
	(TclUtfToUniChar) that does the one-byte utf-char check without
	calling Tcl_UtfToUniChar, for use by the core. This brings notable
	speedups for primarily ascii string handling.

	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_PATCH_LEVEL): bump to 8.4.1.1 for patchlevel
	only. This interim number will only be reflected by [info patchlevel]

2002-11-11  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/Tcl.n: Corrected indentation of the new language. Oops.

2002-11-10  Kevin Kenny <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/Tcl.n: Added language to the Endekalogue to make it clear that
	substitutions always take place from left to right. [Bug 635644]

2002-11-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: Note TclInExit TclInThreadExit changes.
	* generic/tclEvent.c (TclInExit, TclInThreadExit):
	Split out functionality of TclInExit to make it clear which one should
	be called in each situation.
	* generic/tclInt.decls: Declare TclInThreadExit.
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: Regen.
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: Regen.
	* mac/tclMacChan.c (StdIOClose):
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (FileCloseProc):
	* win/tclWinChan.c (FileCloseProc):
	* win/tclWinConsole.c (ConsoleCloseProc):
	* win/tclWinPipe.c (TclpCloseFile):
	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialCloseProc): Invoke the new TclInThreadExit
	method instead of TclInExit.

2002-11-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Generate a fatal configure error if
	no ar program can be found on the path. [Bug 582039]
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Check that AR, RANLIB, and RC are found on the
	path when building with gcc.

2002-11-03  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclAppInit.c:  Calls Registry_Init() and Dde_Init() when
	STATIC_BUILD and TCL_USE_STATIC_PACKAGES macros are set.

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc: linkexten option now sets the TCL_USE_STATIC_PACKAGES
	macro which also adds the registry and dde object files to the link
	of the shell. [Patch 479697]  Also factored some additional macros
	that will be helpful for extension authors. Version grepping of tcl.h
	will need to be added to complete this.

	* win/buildall.vc.bat: Added more descriptive commentary.

2002-11-01  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclWinReg.c: Changed the Tcl_PkgProvide() line to declare the
	registry extension at version 1.1 from 1.0.

2002-10-31  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/word.tcl: Changed $tcl_platform to $::tcl_platform to avoid
	possible scope trouble.

2002-10-29  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: added comments about certain NULL function
	pointers which will be filled in when Tcl_FindExecutable is called, so
	that users don't report invalid bugs on this topic. (No code changes
	at all).

2002-10-29  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c (TclpFindSymbol): pass all dyld error messages
	upstream [Bug 627546].

2002-10-28  Andreas Kupries  <andreask@activestate.com>

	* library/dde/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* library/reg/pkgIndex.tcl: Changed the hardwired debug suffix (d) to

	* library/tclIndex:	[Patch 624509] (steffen)

2002-10-26  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: xcopy on NT 4.0 doesn't support the /Y switch
	(overwrite). Added logic to handle this. [Bug 618019]

2002-10-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclInt.h: Removed definitions of obsolete HistoryEvent and
	HistoryRev structures (the history mechanism has been written in Tcl
	for some time now).

2002-10-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4.1 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* changes: updated for 8.4.1 release

	* win/Makefile.in: removed @MEM_DEBUG_FLAGS@ subst.
	* win/configure: regen
	* win/configure.in: removed SC_ENABLE_MEMDEBUG call
	* win/tcl.m4: replaced SC_ENABLE_MEMDEBUG with a more intelligent
	SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS that takes yes|no|mem|compile|all as options now.

2002-10-22  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/auto.tcl (tcl_findLibrary):

	framework dirs to tcl_pkgPath: @executable_path/../Frameworks and
	@executable_path/../PrivateFrameworks (if they exist), as well as the
	dirs in DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH (if set). [Patch 624509] use standard
	MAXPATHLEN instead of literal 1024

2002-10-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/StringObj.3, doc/Object.3: Documented that Tcl_Obj's
	standard string form is a modified UTF-8; apparently, this was not
	mentioned anywhere in the main docs, and lead to [Bug 624919].

2002-10-21  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: bumped version to 8.4.1
	* generic/tcl.h: Added reminder comment to edit
	macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj when version number changes.

	[Patch 623269] (brouwers)

2002-10-11  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.h: Need a different strategy through the maze of
	#defines to let people building with Cygwin build correctly.  Also
	made some comments less misleading...

2002-10-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README: fixed minor nits [Bug 607776] (virden)

	* win/configure:
	* win/tcl.m4: enable USE_THREAD_ALLOC (new threaded allocator) by
	default in cygwin configure on Windows.

2002-10-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Tcl.n:	Clarified that namespace separators are legal in
			the variable names during $-subtitution. [Bug 615139]

	* doc/regexp.n:	Typo correction.  Thanks Ronnie Brunner. [Bug 606826]

2002-10-10  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclLoadOSF.c
	* unix/tclLoadShl.c
	* win/tclWinLoad.c: allow either full paths or simply dll names to be
	specified when loading files (the latter will be looked up by the OS
	on your PATH/LD_LIBRARY_PATH as appropriate). Fixes [Bug 611108]

2002-10-09  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/README: doc'ed --enable-symbols options.
	* unix/Makefile.in: removed @MEM_DEBUG_FLAGS@ subst.
	* unix/configure: regen
	* unix/configure.in: removed SC_ENABLE_MEMDEBUG call
	* unix/tcl.m4: replaced SC_ENABLE_MEMDEBUG with a more intelligent
	SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS that takes yes|no|mem|compile|all as options now.

2002-10-09  Kevin B. Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinTime.c: Added code to set an exit handler that terminates
	the thread that calibrates the performance counter, so that the thread
	won't outlive unloading the Tcl DLL. [Bug 620735].

2002-10-09  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/binary.n: More clarification of [binary scan]'s behaviour.

2002-10-09  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: fixed botched regen.

2002-10-09  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacPort.h: removed incorrect <fcntl.h> definitions and
	obsolete <stat.h> definitions.
	* mac/tclMacChan.c: removed obsolete GetOpenMode() and replaced
	associated constants with the <fcntl.h> analogues (they existing defs
	were inconsistent with <fcntl.h> which was causing havoc when
	Tcl_GetOpenMode was used instead of private GetOpenMode).

	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c: removed GenerateUniqueName(), use equivalent (and
	identically named) routine from MoreFiles instead.

	* mac/tclMacLoad.c: CONSTification, fixes to Vince's last changes.

	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* mac/tclMacTest.c:
	* mac/tclMacUnix.c: CONSTification.

	* mac/tclMacOSA.c: CONSTification, sprintf fixes, UH 3.4.x changes;
	fix for missing autoname token from TclOSACompileCmd. (bdesgraupes)
	* mac/AppleScript.html(AppleScript delete): doc fix. (bdesgraupes)

	* mac/tcltkMacBuildSupport.sea.hqx: updated MoreFiles to 1.5.3,
	updated build instructions for 8.4.
	* mac/tclMacProjects.sea.hqx: rebuilt archive.

2002-10-09  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/Alloc.3: Added a note to mention that attempting to allocate a
	zero-length block can return NULL. [Tk Bug 619544]

2002-10-04  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/binary.n: Doc improvements [Patch 616480]

	* tests/fCmd.test, tests/winFCmd.test:
	* tools/eolFix.tcl, tools/genStubs.tcl: [file exist] -> [file exists]
	Thanks to David Welton.

2002-10-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n: fixed typo [Bug 618018].  Thanks to "JJM".

2002-10-03  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tools/man2help2.tcl:
	* tests/http.test, tests/httpd, tests/httpold.test:
	* tests/env.test, tests/binary.test, tests/autoMkindex.test:
	* library/init.tcl, library/http/http.tcl: [info exist] should really
	be [info exists]. [Bug 602566]

	* doc/lsearch.n: Better specification of what happens when -sorted is
	mixed with other options. [Bug 617816]

2002-10-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclProc.c (TclCreateProc): mask out VAR_UNDEFINED for
	precompiled locals to support 8.3 precompiled code.
	(Tcl_ProcObjCmd): correct 2002-09-26 fix to look for tclProcBodyType.

2002-10-01  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/socket.n: Mentioned that ports may be specified as serivce names
	as well as integers. [Bug 616843]

2002-09-30  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileRegexpCmd): correct the checking
	for bad re's that didn't terminate the re string.  Resultant compiles
	were correct, but much slower than necessary.

2002-09-29  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/tclAppInit.c: Added proper exiting conditions using Win32
	console signals. This handles the existing lack of a Ctrl+C exit to
	call exit handlers when built for thread support. Also, properly
	handles exits from other conditions such as CTRL_CLOSE_EVENT,
	CTRL_LOGOFF_EVENT, and CTRL_SHUTDOWN_EVENT signals. In all cases, exit
	handlers will be called. [Bug 219355]

	* win/makefile.vc: Added missing tclThreadAlloc.c to the build rules
	and defines USE_THREAD_ALLOC when TCL_THREADS is defined to get the
	new behavior by default.

2002-09-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* README:		Bumped to version 8.4.1 to avoid confusion

2002-09-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure: regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4: improve AIX-4/5 64bit compilation support.

	* generic/tclProc.c (Tcl_ProcObjCmd): correct overeager optimization
	of noop proc to handle the precompiled case. (sofer)

	* unix/ldAix (nmopts): add -X32_64 to make it work for 32 or 64bit
	mode compilation.

	* library/encoding/koi8-u.enc: removed extraneous spaces that confused
	encoding reader. [Bug 615115]

	* unix/Makefile.in: generate source dists with -src designator and do
	not generate .Z anymore (just .gz and .zip).

2002-09-18  Mumit Khan <khan@nanotech.wisc.edu>

	Added basic Cygwin support.

	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG): Support one-tree build.
	(SC_PATH_TKCONFIG): Likewise.
	(SC_PROG_TCLSH): Likewise.
	(SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Assume real Cygwin port and remove -mno-cygwin
	flags.	Add -mwin32 to extra_cflags and extra_ldflags. Remove ``-e
	_WinMain@16'' from LDFLAGS_WINDOW.
	* win/configure.in: Allow Cygwin build.
	(SEH test): Define to be 1 instead of empty value.
	(EXCEPTION_DISPOSITION): Add test.
	* win/configure: Regenerate.

	* generic/tcl.h: Don't explicitly define __WIN32__ for Cygwin, let the
	user decide whether to use Windows or POSIX personality.
	(TCL_WIDE_INT_TYPE, TCL_LL_MODIFIER, struct Tcl_StatBuf): Define for
	Cygwin.
	* generic/tclEnv.c (Tcl_CygwinPutenv): putenv replacement for Cygwin.
	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_TranslateFileName): Convert POSIX to
	native format.
	(TclDoGlob): Likewise.
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h (TCHAR): Define for Cygwin.
	* win/tclWinPort.h (putenv, TclpSysAlloc, TclpSysFree)
	(TclpSysRealloc): Define for Cygwin.

2002-09-26  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Makefile: preserve environment value of INSTALL_ROOT. When
	embedding only use deployment build. Force relink before embedded
	build to ensure new linker flags are picked up.

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: add symbolic links to debug lib,
	stub libs and tclConfig.sh in framework toplevel. Configure target
	dependency fix. Fix to 'clean' action. Added private tcl headers to
	framework. Install tclsh symbolic link. Html doc build works when no
	installed tclsh available. Made html doc structure in framework more
	like in Apple frameworks.

2002-09-24  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_TCL_64BIT_FLAGS): Yet more robust 64-bit value
	detection to close [Bug 613117] on more systems.

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclPrintSource): More CONSTifying.
	* generic/tclExecute.c (EvalStatsCmd): Object-ify to reduce warnings.
	Thanks to 'CoderX2' on the chat for bringing this to my attention...

	* unix/tcl.m4: Forgot to define TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG at the
	appropriate moment. I believe this is the cause of [Bug 613117]

	* doc/lset.n: Changed 'list' to 'varName' for consistency with lappend
	documentation. Thanks to Glenn Jackman [Bug 611719]

2002-09-22  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Corrected [puts -nonewline] within
	test bodies. Thanks to Harald Kirsch. [Bug 612786, Patch 612788] Also
	corrected reporting of body return code. Thanks to David Taback [Bug
	611922]
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl: Bump to version 2.2.1.
	* tests/tcltest.test: added tests for these bugs.

2002-09-15  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Add PEEK_XCLOSEIM define under
	Linux. This is used by Tk to double check that an X input context is
	cleaned up before it is closed.

2002-09-12  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/coffbase.txt: Added BLT to the virtual base address listings
	table should BLT's build tools decide to use it.

2002-09-12  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* mac/tclMacApplication.r:
	* mac/tclMacLibrary.r:
	* mac/tclMacResource.r: unified use of the two equivalent resource
	compiler header inclusion defines RC_INVOKED and RESOURCE_INCLUDED,
	now use RC_INVOKED throughout.

2002-09-10  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/README: Add note about building extensions with the same
	compiler Tcl was built with. [Tk Bug 592096]

2002-09-10  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: disabled building html
	documentation during embedded build.

2002-09-10  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: added DYLIB_INSTALL_DIR variable for macosx and
	set it to default value ${LIB_RUNTIME_DIR}
	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): use DYLIB_INSTALL_DIR instead of
	LIB_RUNTIME_DIR in the -install_name argument to ld.
	* unix/configure: regen.

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj:
	* macosx/Makefile: added support for building Tcl as an embedded
	framework, i.e. using an dyld install_name containing
	@executable_path/../Frameworks via the new DYLIB_INSTALL_DIR
	unix/Makefile variable.

2002-09-10  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4.0 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* doc/tcltest.n:  Added examples section, as long promised.

2002-09-06  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* tests/tcltest.test: Added nonRoot flag to tests 8.3, 8.4, and 8.12.

2002-09-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:  Clarified phrasing.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclRenameCommand,CallCommandTraces):
	* tests/trace.test (trace-27.1): Corrected memory leak when a rename
	trace deleted the command being traced. Test added. Thanks to Hemang
	Lavana for the fix. [Bug 604609]

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclDeleteVars):  Corrected logic for setting the
	TCL_INTERP_DESTROYED flag when calling variable traces. [Tk Bug 605121]

2002-09-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (DeleteArray): leak plug [Bug 604239]. Thanks to
	dkf and dgp for the long and difficult discussion in the chat.

2002-09-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_UpVar2): code cleanup to not use goto

	* unix/configure: remove -pthread from LIBS on FreeBSD in thread
	* unix/tcl.m4:	  enabled build. [Bug 602849]

2002-09-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c (AliasCreate): a Tcl_Obj was leaked on error
	return from TclPreventAliasLoop.

2002-09-03  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj: Bumped version number to 8.4.0
	and updated copyright info.

2002-09-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_UpVar2): a Tcl_Obj was being leaked on error
	return from TclGetFrame.

2002-09-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes:  Updated changes for 8.4.0 release.

2002-09-02  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c (TclpObjLink): removed unnecessary/unfreed
	extra native char*.

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (Tcl_MakeTcpClientChannel): make sure to init
	flags field of TcpState ptr to 0.

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added 64-bit gcc compilation support on HP-11.
	[Patch 601051] (martin)

	* README:		Bumped version number to 8.4.0
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* unix/configure:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* win/README.binary:
	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in:

	* generic/tclInterp.c (SlaveCreate): make sure that the memory and
	checkmem commands are initialized in non-safe slave interpreters when
	TCL_MEM_DEBUG is used. [Bug 583445]

	* win/tclWinConsole.c (ConsoleCloseProc): only wait on writable pipe
	if there was something to write. This may prevent infinite wait on
	exit.

	* tests/exec.test: marked exec-18.1 unixOnly until the Windows
	incompatability (in the test, not the core) can be resolved.

	* tests/http.test (http-3.11): added close $fp that was causing an
	error on Windows because the file was not closed before deleting.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c (Tcl_MacOSXGetLibraryPath): made this static
	function only appear when HAVE_CFBUNDLE is defined.

2002-08-31  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4: added TK_SHLIB_LD_EXTRAS analogue of existing
	TCL_SHLIB_LD_EXTRAS for linker settings only used when linking Tk.

	* unix/configure: regen

2002-08-31  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	*** macosx-8-4-branch merged into the mainline [Patch 602770] ***

	* generic/tcl.decls: added new macosx specific entry to stubs table.

	* tools/genStubs.tcl: added generation of platform guards for macosx.
	This is a little more complex than it seems, because MacOS X IS "unix"
	plus a little bit, for the purposes of Tcl. BUT unfortunately, Tk uses
	"unix" to mean X11. So added platform keys for macosx (the little
	added to "unix"), "aqua" and "x11" to distinguish these for Tk.

	* generic/tcl.h: added a #ifnded RESOURCE_INCLUDED so that tcl.h can
	be passed to the resource compiler.

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclNotify.c: added a few Notifier procs, to be able to
	modify more bits of the Tcl notifier dynamically. Required to get Mac
	OS X Tk to live on top of the Tcl Unix threaded notifier.  Changes the
	size of the Tcl_NotifierProcs structure, but doesn't move any elements
	around.

	* unix/tclUnixNotfy.c: moved the call to Tcl_ConditionNotify till
	AFTER we are done mucking with the pointer swap. Fixes cases where the
	thread waiting on the condition wakes & accesses the waitingListPtr
	before it gets reset, causing a hang.

	* library/auto.tcl (tcl_findLibrary): added checking the directories
	in the tcl_pkgPath for library files on macosx to enable support of
	the standard Mac OSX library locations

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added MAC_OSX_DIR. Added PLAT_OBJS to the OBJS: there
	are some MacOS X specific files now for Tcl, and when I get he
	resource & applescript stuff ported over, and restore support for
	FindFiles, etc, there will be a few more. Added LD_LIBRARY_PATH_VAR
	configure variable to avoid having to set all possible LD_LIBRARY_PATH
	analogues on all platforms. LD_LIBRARY_PATH_VAR is "LD_LIBRARY_PATH"
	by default, "LIBPATH" on AIX, "SHLIB_PATH" on HPUX and
	"DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH" on Mac OSX. Added configure option to package Tcl
	as a framework on Mac OSX.

	* macosx/tclMacOSXBundle.c (new): support for finding Tcl extension
	packaged as 'bundles' in the standard Mac OSX library locations.

	* unix/tclUnixInit.c: added support for findig the tcl script library
	inside Tcl packaged as a framework on Mac OSX.

	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/jingham.pbxuser (new):
	* macosx/Tcl.pbproj/project.pbxproj (new): project for Apple's
	ProjectBuilder IDE.

	* macosx/Makefile (new): simple makefile for building the project from
	the command line via the ProjectBuilder tool 'pbxbuild'.

	* unix/configure:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h: regen

2002-08-29  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinThrd.c (TclpFinalizeThreadData, TclWinFreeAllocCache):
	Applied patch for [Bug 599428] (sofer)

2002-08-28  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* generic/tclEnv.c:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/tclWinPort.h:  putenv() on some systems copies the buffer rather
	than taking reference to it. This causes memory leaks and is know to
	effect mswindows (msvcrt) and NetBSD 1.5.2. This patch tests for this
	behavior and turns on -DHAVE_PUTENV_THAT_COPIES=1 when approriate.
	Thanks to David Welton for assistance. [Bug 414910]

	* unix/configure: regen'd

2002-08-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/eval.n: Added mention of list command and corrected "SEE ALSO".

	* unix/configure.in: Cache handling of ac_cv_type_socklen_t was wrong.
	[Bug 600931] reported by John Ellson. Fixed by putting the brackets
	where they belong.

2002-08-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c: fix for [Bug 599788] (error in element name
	causing segfault), reported by Tom Wilkason. Fixed by copying the
	tokens instead of the source string.

2002-08-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c: small optimisation, reducing the new
	allocator's overhead.

2002-08-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c (USE_THREAD_ALLOC): fixed leak [Bug 597936]. Thanks
	to Zoran Vasiljevic.

2002-08-23  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (USE_THREAD_ALLOC): moving objects between
	caches as a block, instead of one-by-one.

2002-08-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: fix for freed memory r/w in delete traces [Bug
	589863], patch by Hemang Lavana.

2002-08-20  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/Makefile.in (CFLAGS):
	* unix/Makefile.in (MEM_DEBUG_FLAGS): Added usage of @MEM_DEBUG_FLAGS@.
	* win/configure.in:
	* unix/configure.in: Added usage of SC_ENABLE_MEMDEBUG.
	* win/tcl.m4:
	* unix/tcl.m4: Added macro SC_ENABLE_MEMDEBUG. Allows a user of
	configure to (de)activate memory validation and debugging
	(TCL_MEM_DEBUG). No need to modify the makefile anymore.

2002-08-20  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c:	CONSTified MemoryCmd and CheckmemCmd.

	* README:		Bumped version number to 8.4b3 to distinguish
	* generic/tcl.h:	HEAD from the 8.4b2 release.
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* win/README.binary:
	* win/configure.in:

	* unix/configure:	autoconf
	* win/configure:

	* library/http/http.tcl:	Corrected installation directory of
	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:	the package tcltest 2.2.  Added
	* library/opt/optparse.tcl:	comments in other packages to remind
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	that installation directories need
	* unix/Makefile.in:		updates to match increasing version
	* win/Makefile.in:		numbers. [Bug 597450]
	* win/makefile.bc:
	* win/makefile.vc:

2002-08-19  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixTest.c (TestfilehandlerCmd): Changed
	readable/writable to the more common readable|writable.
	Fixes [Bug 596034] (lvirden)

2002-08-16  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/fCmd.test: Added test to make sure that the cause of the
	problem is detectable with an unpatched Tcl.
	* doc/ObjectType.3: Added note on the root cause of this problem to
	the documentation, since it is possible for user code to trigger this
	sort of behaviour too.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (SetFsPathFromAny): Objects should only have
	their old representation deleted when we know that we are about to
	install a new one.  This stops a weird TclX bug under Linux with
	certain kinds of memory debugging enabled which essentally came down
	to a double-free of a string.

2002-08-14  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c: (code cleanup) factored the parts in the macros
	TclNewObj() / TclDecrRefCount() into a common part for all memory
	allocators and two new macros TclAllocObjStorage() /
	TclFreeObjStorage() that are specific to each allocator and fully
	describe the differences. Removed allocator-specific code from
	tclObj.c by using the macros.

2002-08-12  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: fixing UMR in delete traces, [Bug 589863].

2002-08-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/man2help.tcl: Fixed $argv handling bug where if -bitmap wasn't
	specified $argc was off by one.

2002-08-08  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/uplevel.test: added 6.1 to test [uplevel] with shadowed
	commands [Bug 524383]

	* tests/subst.test: added 5.8-10 as further tests for [Bug 495207]

2002-08-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/README: Noted removal of defs.tcl.

2002-08-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/lsearch.n: corrected lsearch docs to use -inline in examples.

	*** 8.4b2 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* tests/unixFCmd.test: updated tests for new link copy behavior.
	* generic/tclFCmd.c (CopyRenameOneFile): changed the behavior to
	follow links to endpoints and copy that file/directory instead of just
	copying the surface link. This means that trying to copy a link that
	has no endpoint (danling link) is an error. [Patch 591647] (darley)
	(CopyRenameOneFile): this is currently disabled by default until
	further issues with such behavior (like relative links) can be handled
	correctly.

	* tests/README: slight wording improvements

2002-08-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docs/BoolObj.3: added description of valid string reps for a boolean
	object [Bug 584794]
	* generic/tclObj.c: optimised Tcl_GetBooleanFromObj and
	SetBooleanFromAny to avoid parsing the string rep when it can be
	avoided [Bugs 584650, 472576]

2002-08-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c: making tclCmdNameType static [Bug 584567] (dgp)

2002-08-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c (Tcl_NewObj): added conditional code for
	USE_THREAD_ALLOC; objects allocated through Tcl_NewObj() were
	otherwise being leaked. [Bug 587488] reported by Sven Sass.

2002-08-06  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c: Added stubs and implementations for non-threaded
	build for the tclUnixThrd.c procs TclpReaddir, TclpLocaltime,
	TclpGmtime and TclpInetNtoa. Fixes link errors in stubbed & threaded
	extensions that include tclUnixPort.h and use any of the procs
	readdir, localtime, gmtime or inet_ntoa (e.g. TclX 8.4) [Bug 589526]
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: Regen.

2002-08-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	The setup and cleanup scripts are now
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:	skipped when a test is skipped, fixing
	* tests/tcltest.test:		[Bug 589859]. Test for bug added, and
	corrected tcltest package bumped to version 2.2.

	* generic/tcl.decls:	Restored Tcl_Concat to return (char *). Like
	* generic/tclDecls.h:	Tcl_Merge, it transfers ownership of a dynamic
	* generic/tclUtil.c:	allocated string to the caller.

2002-08-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/CmdCmplt.3:	Applied Patch 585105 to fully CONST-ify
	* doc/Concat.3:		all remaining public interfaces of Tcl.
	* doc/CrtCommand.3:	Notably, the parser no longer writes on
	* doc/CrtSlave.3:	the string it is parsing, so it is no
	* doc/CrtTrace.3:	longer necessary for Tcl_Eval() to be
	* doc/Eval.3:		given a writable string.  Also, the
	* doc/ExprLong.3:	refactoring of the Tcl_*Var* routines
	* doc/LinkVar.3:	by Miguel Sofer is included, so that the
	* doc/ParseCmd.3:	"part1" argument for them no longer needs
	* doc/SetVar.3:		to be writable either.
	* doc/TraceVar.3:
	* doc/UpVar.3:		Compatibility support has been enhanced so
	* generic/tcl.decls:	that a #define of USE_NON_CONST will remove
	* generic/tcl.h:	all possible source incompatibilities with
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	the 8.3 version of the header file(s).
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:	The new #define of USE_COMPAT_CONST now does
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:what USE_NON_CONST used to do -- disable
	* generic/tclCompExpr.c:only those new CONST's that introduce
	* generic/tclCompile.c:	irreconcilable incompatibilities.
	* generic/tclCompile.h:
	* generic/tclDecls.h:	Several bugs are also fixed by this patch.
	* generic/tclEnv.c:	[Bugs 584051,580433] [Patches 585105,582429]

2002-08-01  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: bugfix (reading freed memory). Testsuite
	passed on linux/i386, compile-13.1 hung on linux/alpha.

2002-08-01  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: added a reference count for the complete
	execution stack, instead of Tcl_Preserve/Tcl_Release.

2002-08-01  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c (TclFinalizeMemorySubsystem): Don't lock the
	ckalloc mutex before invoking the Tcl_DumpActiveMemory function since
	it also locks the same mutex. This code is only executed when "memory
	onexit filename" has been executed and Tcl is compiled with
	-DTCL_MEM_DEBUG.

2002-08-01  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* win/tclWinPort.h: The windows headers don't provide socklen_t, so we
	have to do it.

2002-07-31  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h (USE_THREAD_ALLOC): for unshared objects,
	TclDecrRefCount now frees the internal rep before the string rep -
	just like the non-macro Tcl_DecrRefCount/TclFreeObj [Bug 524802]. For
	the other allocators the fix was done on 2002-03-06.

2002-07-31  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInterp.c: signed/unsigned comparison warning fixed
	(Vince Darley).

2002-07-31  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_BUGGY_STRTOD): Enabled caching of test results.

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_BUGGY_STRTOD): Solaris 2.8 still has a buggy
	strtod() implementation; make sure we detect it.

	* tests/expr.test (expr-22.*): Marked as non-portable because it seems
	that these tests have an annoying tendency to fail in unexpected ways.
	[Bugs 584825, 584950, 585986]

2002-07-30  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test:
	* generic/tclIO.c (WriteChars): Added flag to break out of loop if
	nothing of the input is consumed at all, to prevent infinite looping
	of called with a non-UTF-8 string. Fixes [Bug 584603] partially.
	Added new test "io-60.1". Might need additional changes to Tcl_Main so
	that unprintable results are printed as binary data.

2002-07-29  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Use CC_SEARCH_FLAGS instead of LD_SEARCH_FLAGS
	when linking with ${CC}.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Don't subst CC_SEARCH_FLAGS or LD_SEARCH_FLAGS
	since this is now done in tcl.m4.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Document and set CC_SEARCH_FLAGS
	whenever LD_SEARCH_FLAGS is set. [Patch 588290]

2002-07-29  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_SERIAL_PORT): Fixed detection for cases when
					configure's stdin is not a tty.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* generic/tclIOSock.c:		Changed size_t to socklen_t in
					socket-related function calls.

	* unix/configure.in:		Added test and fallback definition
					for socklen_t.

	* unix/configure:		generated.

2002-07-29  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclObj.c: fixed a comment

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclInterp.c: added the new flag TCL_EVAL_INVOKE to the
	interface of the Tcl_Eval* functions, removing the
	TCL_EVAL_NO_TRACEBACK added yesterday: alias invocations not only
	require no tracebacks, but also look up the command name in the global
	scope - see new test interp-9.4
	* tests/interp.test: added 9.3 to test for safety of aliases to hidden
	commands, 9.4 to test for correct command lookup scope.

2002-07-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/regc_locale.c (cclass): [[:xdigit:]] is only a defined
	concept on western characters, so should not allow any unicode digit,
	and hence number of ranges in [[:xdigit:]] is fixed.
	* tests/reg.test: Added test to detect the bug.
	* generic/regc_cvec.c (newcvec): Corrected initial size value in
	character vector structure. [Bug 578363] Many thanks to
	pvgoran@users.sf.net for tracking this down.

2002-07-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c: added the new flag TCL_EVAL_NO_TRACEBACK to the
	interface of the Tcl_Eval* functions. Modified the error message for
	too many nested evaluations.
	* generic/tclInterp.h: changed the Alias struct to be of variable
	length and store the prefix arguments directly (instead of a pointer
	to a Tcl_Obj list). Made AliasObjCmd call Tcl_EvalObjv instead of
	TclObjInvoke - thus making aliases trigger execution traces. [Bug
	582522]
	* tests/interp.test:
	* tests/stack.test: adapted to the new error message.
	* tests/trace.test: added tests for aliases firing the exec traces.

2002-07-27  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Revert fix for Tcl bug 529801 since it was
	incorrect and broke the build on other systems. Fix [Bug 587299]. Add
	MAJOR_VERSION, MINOR_VERSION, PATCH_LEVEL, SHLIB_LD_FLAGS,
	SHLIB_LD_LIBS, CC_SEARCH_FLAGS, LD_SEARCH_FLAGS, and LIB_FILE
	variables to support more generic library build/install rules.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Move AC_PROG_RANLIB into tcl.m4. Move shared
	build test and setting of MAKE_LIB and MAKE_STUB_LIB into tcl.m4. Move
	subst of a number of variables into tcl.m4 where they are defined.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_ENABLE_SYMBOLS, SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS):
	Subst vars where they are defined. Add MAKE_LIB, MAKE_STUB_LIB,
	INSTALL_LIB, and INSTALL_STUB_LIB rules to deal with the ugly details
	of running ranlib on static libs at build and install time. Replace
	TCL_SHLIB_LD_EXTRAS with SHLIB_LD_FLAGS and use it when building a
	shared library.
	* unix/tclConfig.sh.in: Add TCL_CC_SEARCH_FLAGS.

2002-07-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: fixed Tcl_Obj leak in code corresponding to
	the macro NEXT_INST_V(x, 0, 1). [Bug 587495]

2002-07-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclObjLookupVar): leak fix and improved comments.

2002-07-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclLookupVar): removed early returns that
	prevented the parens from being restored. also removed goto label as
	it was not necessary.

2002-07-24  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* tests/expr-old.test: fix for erroneous error messages in [expr],
	[Bug 587140] reported by Martin Lemburg.

2002-07-25  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c: fix for [Tk Bug 219218] "error handling with
	bgerror in Tk"

2002-07-24  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: restoring full TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG
	functionality.

2002-07-24  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test: relaxed unixInit-3.1 to accept iso8859-15 as a
	valid C encoding. [Bug 575336]

2002-07-24  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: restoring the tcl_traceCompile functionality
	while I repair tcl_traceExec. The core now compiles and runs also
	under TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG, but execution in the bytecode engine can
	still not be traced.

2002-07-24  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/configure.in: corrected fix for [Bug 529801]: ranlib only
	needed for static builds on Mac OS X.
	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c: fixed small bugs introduced by Vince,
	implemented library unloading correctly (needs OS X 10.2).

2002-07-23  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/OpenFileChnl.3: (Updates from Larry Virden)
	* doc/open.n:
	* doc/tclsh.1: Fix section numbers in Unix man page references.
	* doc/lset.n:  In EXAMPLES section, include command to set the initial
	value used in subsequent examples.
	* doc/http.n: Package version updated to 2.4.

2002-07-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Enable 64 bit compilation when using
	the native compiler on a 64 bit version of IRIX. [Bug 219220]

2002-07-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Combine ranlib tests and avoid printing unless
	ranlib is actually run.

2002-07-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_X): Set XINCLUDES to "" instead of "# no
	special path needed" or "# no include files found" when x headers
	cannot be located.

2002-07-22  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: made tclNativeFilesystem static (since 07-19
	changes removed its usage elsewhere), and added comments about its
	usage.
	* generic/tclLoad.c:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* doc/FileSystem.3: converted last load-related ClientData parameter
	to Tcl_LoadHandle opaque structure, removing a couple of casts in the
	process.

	* generic/tclInt.h: removed tclNativeFilesystem declaration since it
	is now static again.

2002-07-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/expr.test (expr-22.*): Added tests to help detect the
	corrected handling.
	* generic/tclExecute.c (IllegalExprOperandType): Improved error
	message generated when attempting to manipulate Inf and NaN values.
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c (GetLexeme): Allowed parser to recognise
	'Inf' as a floating-point number. [Bug 218000]

2002-07-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tclIOUtil.c: Silence compiler warning. [Bug 584408].

2002-07-19  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to GetFilesystemRecord
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c: fix to subtle problem with links shown up by
	latest tclkit builds.

2002-07-19  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/configure:
	* win/configure.in: Add AC_PREREQ(2.13) in an attempt to make it more
	clear that the configure scripts must be generated with autoconf
	version 2.13. [Bug 583573]

2002-07-19  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: fix to build on MacOS X [Bug 529801], bug report
	and fix from jcw.

2002-07-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (no_timeout): Made this variable static.

	* generic/tclExecute.c, generic/tclCompile.c, generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.h (builtinFuncTable, instructionTable): Added
	prefix to these symbols because they are visible outside the Tcl
	library.

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c (operatorTable):
	* unix/tclUnixTime.c (tmKey):
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (theFilesystemEpoch, filesystemWantToModify,
	(filesystemIteratorsInProgress, filesystemOkToModify): Made these
	variables static.

	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:		Renamed nativeFilesystem to
	* win/tclWinFile.c:		tclNativeFilesystem and declared
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:		it properly in tclInt.h
	* generic/tclInt.h:

	* generic/tclUtf.c (totalBytes): Made this array static and const.

	* generic/tclParse.c (typeTable): Made this array static and const.
	(Tcl_ParseBraces): Simplified error handling case so that scans are
	only performed when needed, and flags are simpler too.

	* license.terms: Added AS to list of copyright holders; it's only fair
	for the current gatekeepers to be listed here!

	* tests/cmdMZ.test: Renamed constraint for clarity. [Bug 583427]
	Added tests for the [time] command, which was previously only
	indirectly tested!

2002-07-18  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* */*Load*.c: added comments on changes of 07/17 and replaced
	clientData with Tcl_LoadHandle in all locations.

	* generic/tclFCmd.c:
	* tests/fileSystem.test: fixed a 'knownBug' with 'file
	attributes ""'
	* tests/winFCmd.test:
	* tests/winPipe.test:
	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* tessts/winFile.test: added 'pcOnly' constraint to some tests to make
	for more useful 'tests skipped' log from running all tests on
	non-Windows platforms.

2002-07-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (CallCommandTraces): delete traces now receive
	the FQ old name of the command. [Bug 582532] (Don Porter)

2002-07-18  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/ioUtil.test: added constraints to 1.4,2.4 so they don't run
	outside of tcltest. [Bugs 583276,583277]

2002-07-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (DupParsedVarName): nasty bug fixed, reported by
	Vince Darley.

2002-07-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c (TclPtrIncrVar): missing CONST in declarations,
	inconsistent with tclInt.h. Thanks to Vince Darley for reporting, boo
	to gcc for not complaining.

2002-07-17  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclLoadNone.c:
	* unix/tclLoadAout.c:
	* unix/tclLoadDl.c:
	* unix/tclLoadDld.c:
	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c:
	* unix/tclLoadNext.c:
	* unix/tclLoadOSF.c:
	* unix/tclLoadShl.c:
	* mac/tclMacLoad.c:
	* win/tclWinLoad.c: modified to move more functionality to the generic
	code and avoid duplication. Partial replacement of internal uses of
	clientData with opaque Tcl_LoadHandle. A little further work still
	needed, but significant changes are done.

2002-07-17  D. Richard Hipp    <drh@hwaci.com>

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl: fix a comment that was causing problems
	for programs (ex: mktclapp) that embed the initialization scripts in
	strings.

2002-07-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c: removing the now redundant functions to access
	indexed variables: Tcl(Get|Set|Incr)IndexedScalar() and
	Tcl(Get|Set|Incr)ElementOfIndexedArray().

2002-07-17  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): Minor fixes to make this
	file compile with SunPro CC...

2002-07-17  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: modified to do variable lookup explicitly, and
	then either inlining the variable access or else calling the new
	TclPtr(Set|Get|Incr)Var functions in tclVar.c
	* generic/tclInt.h: declare some functions previously local to
	tclVar.c for usage by TEBC.
	* generic/tclVar.c: removed local declarations; moved all special
	accessor functions for indexed variables to the end of the file - they
	are unused and ready for removal, but left there for the time being as
	they are in the internal stubs table.

	** WARNING FOR BYTECODE MAINTAINERS **
	TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG is currently not functional; will be fixed ASAP.

2002-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* win/Makefile.in: Add a more descriptive warning in the event `make
	genstubs` needs to be rerun.

2002-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Use dltest.marker file to keep track of when the
	dltest package is up to date. This fixes [Bug 575768] since tcltest is
	no longer linked every time.
	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Create ../dltest.marker after a successful
	`make all` run in dltest.

2002-07-16  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Remove useless subst of TCL_BIN_DIR.

2002-07-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: inaccurate comment fixed

2002-07-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_AddObjErrorInfo):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclUpdateReturnInfo):
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclProc.c:
	Added two Tcl_Obj to the ExecEnv structure to hold the fully qualified
	names "::errorInfo" and "::errorCode" to cache the addresses of the
	corresponding variables. The two most frequent setters of these
	variables now profit from the new variable name caching.

2002-07-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: refactorisation to reuse already looked-up Var
	pointers; definition of three new Tcl_Obj types to cache variable name
	parsing and lookup for later reuse; modification of internal functions
	to profit from the caching.

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclNamesp.c: adding CONST qualifiers to variable names
	passed to Tcl_FindNamespaceVar and to variable resolvers; adding CONST
	qualifier to the 'msg' argument to TclLookupVar. Needed to avoid code
	duplication in the new tclVar.c code.

	* tests/set-old.test:
	* tests/var.test: slight modification of error messages due to the
	modifications in the tclVar.c code.

2002-07-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/unixInit.test:	Improved constraints to protect /tmp. [Bug
	581403]

2002-07-15  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winFCmd.test: renamed 'win2000' and 'notWin2000' to more
	appropriate constraint names.
	* win/tclWinFile.c: updated comments to reflect 07-11 changes.
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: made ConvertFileNameFormat static again, since no
	longer used in tclWinFile.c
	* mac/tclMacFile.c: completed TclpObjLink implementation which was
	previously lacking.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: comment cleanup and code speedup.

2002-07-14  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:	Removed declarations that duplicated entries
	in the (internal) stub table.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Corrected errors in handling of
	configuration options -constraints and -limitconstraints.

	* README:		Bumped HEAD to version 8.4b2 so we can
	* generic/tcl.h:	distinguish it from the 8.4b1 release.
	* tools/tcl.wse.in:
	* unix/configure*:
	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* win/README.binary:
	* win/configure*:

2002-07-11  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: on Win 95/98/ME the long form of the path is used
	as a normalized form. This is required because short forms are not a
	robust representation. The file normalization function has been sped
	up, but more performance gains might be possible, if speed is still an
	issue on these platforms.

2002-07-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Corrected reaction to existing but
	false ::tcl_interactive.

	* doc/Hash.3: Overlooked CONST documentation update.

2002-07-11  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCkalloc.c: ckalloc() and friends take the block size as
	an unsigned, so we should use %ud when reporting it in fprintf() and
	panic().

2002-07-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c: now setting local vars undefined at compile
	time, instead of waiting until the proc is initialized.
	* generic/tclProc.c: use macro TclSetVarUndefined instead of directly
	setting the flag.

2002-07-11  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: [file attr -perm] is Unix-only, so add [catch]
	when not inside a suitably-protected test.

2002-07-10  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/unixFCmd.test, tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/fCmd.test: Removed [exec] of Unix utilities that have
	equivalents in standard Tcl. [Bug 579268] Also simplified some of
	unixFCmd.test while I was at it.

2002-07-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test:  Greatly reduced the number of [exec]s, using
	slave interps instead.
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Fixed bug uncovered in the conversion
	where a message was written to stdout instead of [outputChannel].

	* tests/basic.test:	Cleaned up, constrained, and reduced the
	* tests/compile.test:	amount of [exec] usage in the test suite.
	* tests/encoding.test:
	* tests/env.test:
	* tests/event.test:
	* tests/exec.test:
	* tests/io.test:
	* tests/ioCmd.test:
	* tests/regexp.test:
	* tests/regexpComp.test:
	* tests/socket.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test:
	* tests/unixInit.test:
	* tests/winDde.test:
	* tests/winPipe.test:

2002-07-10  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdAH.test: Removed [exec] of Unix utilities. [Bug 579211]

	* tests/expr.test: Added tests to make sure that this works.
	* generic/tclExecute.c (ExprCallMathFunc): Functions should also be
	able to return wide-ints. [Bug 579284]

2002-07-08  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/socket.test: Fixed [Bug 578164]. The original reason for the
	was a DNS outage while running the testsuite. Changed [info hostname]
	to 127.0.0.1 to bypass DNS, knowing that we operate on the local
	host.

2002-07-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:		Fixed incompatibility in [viewFile].
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Corrected docs. Bumped to 2.2.1.
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl: [Bug 578163]

2002-07-08  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* tests/fileName.test: tests which rely on 'file link' need a
	constraint so they don't run on older Windows OS. [Bug 578158]
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* mac/tclMacChan.c:
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c:
	* win/tclWinChan.c:
	* doc/FileSystem.3: cleaned up internal handling of
	Tcl_FSOpenFileChannel to remove duplicate code, and make writing
	external vfs's clearer and easier. No functionality change. Also
	clarify that objects with refCount zero should not be passed in to the
	Tcl_FS API, and prevent segfaults from occuring on such user errors.
	[Bug 578617]

2002-07-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test:  Constrained tests of [load] package indexing
	to those platforms where the testing shared libraries have been built.
	[Bug 578166].

2002-07-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: added recent changes

2002-07-05  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* generic/tclClock.c (FormatClock): Convert the format string to
	UTF8 before calling TclpStrftime, so that non-ASCII characters don't
	get mangled when the result string is being converted back.
	* tests/clock.test: Added a test for that.

2002-07-05  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/Makefile.in (ro-test,ddd,GDB,DDD): Created new targets to allow
	running the test suite with a read-only current directory, running
	under ddd instead of gdb, and factored out some executable names for
	broken sites (like mine) where gdb and ddd are installed with
	non-standard names...

	* tests/httpold.test: Altered test names to httpold-* to avoid clashes
	with http.test, and stopped tests from failing when the current
	directory is not writable...

	* tests/event.test:		Stop these tests from failing
	* tests/ioUtil.test:		when the current directory is
	* tests/regexp.test:		not writable...
	* tests/regexpComp.test:
	* tests/source.test:
	* tests/unixFile.test:
	* tests/unixNotfy.test:

	* tests/unixFCmd.test:		Trying to make these test-files
	* tests/macFCmd.test:		not bomb out with an error when
	* tests/http.test:		the current directory is not
	* tests/fileName.test:		writable...
	* tests/env.test:

2002-07-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4b1 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

2002-07-04  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/cmdMZ.test (cmdMZ-1.4):
	* tests/cmdAH.test: More fixing of writable-current-dir assumption.
	[Bug 575824]

2002-07-04  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/basic.test: Same issue as below; fixed [Bug 575817]

2002-07-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/socket.test:
	* tests/winPipe.test:
	* tests/pid.test: Fixed [Bug 575848]. See below for a description the
	general problem.

	All the bugs below are instances of the same problem: The testsuite
	assumes [pwd] = [temporaryDirectory] and writable.

	* tests/iogt.test: Fixed [Bug 575860]
	* tests/io.test:   Fixed [Bug 575862]
	* tests/exec.test:
	* tests/ioCmd.test: Fixed [Bug 575836]

	* tests/pkg1/direct1.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg1/pkgIndex.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test: Imported auxilliary files from tests/pkg1
	into the test file pkgMkIndex.test itself. Formatting fixes.

	* unix/Makefile.in: removed tests/pkg/* from `make dist`

	* tests/pkg/circ1.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg/circ2.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg/circ3.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg/global.tcl: removed

	* tests/pkg/pkg4.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg/pkg5.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg/pkga.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg/samename.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg/simple.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg/spacename.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkg/std.tcl: removed
	* tests/pkgMkIndex.test: Fixed [Bug 575857] where this test file
	expected to be able to write to [file join [testsDirectory] pkg]. Part
	of the fix was to import several auxilliary files into the test file
	itself.

	* tests/main.test:	Cheap fix for [Bugs 575851, 575858]. Avoid
	* tests/tcltest.test:	non-writable . by [cd [temporaryDirectory]].

	* library/auto.tcl: Fix [tcl_findLibrary] to be sure it sets $varName
	only if a successful library script is found. [Bug 577033]

2002-07-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileCatchCmd): return
	TCL_OUT_LINE_COMPILE instead of TCL_ERROR: let the failure happen at
	runtime so that it can be caught [Bug 577015].

2002-07-02  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n: Markup fixes, spellcheck.

2002-07-02  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n: more refinements of the documentation.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Added trace to be sure the stdio
	constraint is updated whenever the [interpreter] changes.

	* doc/tcltest.n:		Reverted [makeFile] and [viewFile] to
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	their former behavior, and documented
	* tests/cmdAH.test:		it. Corrected misspelling of hook
	* tests/event.test:		procedure. Restored tests.
	* tests/http.test:
	* tests/io.test:

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Simplified logic of [GetMatchingFiles]
	and [GetMatchingDirectories], removing special case processing.

	* doc/tcltest.n: More documentation updates. Reference sections are
	complete. Only examples need adding.

2002-07-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: clearer error msgs for 'file link', as per the
	man page.

2002-07-01  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Made Solaris use gcc for linking
	when building with gcc to resolve problems with undefined symbols
	being present when tcl library used with non-gcc linker at later
	stage. Symbols were compiler-generated, so it is the compiler's
	business to define them. [Bug 541181]

2002-07-01  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n: more work in progress updating tcltest docs.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Change [configure -match] to stop
	treating an empty list as a list of the single pattern "*". Changed
	the default value to [list *] so default operation remains the same.

	* tests/pkg/samename.tcl: restored. Needed by pkgMkIndex.test.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: restored writeability testing of
	-tmpdir, augmented by a special exception for the deafault value.

2002-07-01  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/concat.n: Documented the *real* behaviour of [concat]!

2002-06-30  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n: more work in progress updating tcltest docs.

	* tests/README:		Updated the instructions on running and
	* tests/cmdMZ.test:	adding to the test suite.  Also updated
	* tests/encoding.test:	several tests, mostly to correctly create
	* tests/fCmd.test:	and destroy any temporary files in the
	* tests/info.test:	[temporaryDirectory] of tcltest.
	* tests/interp.test:

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Stopped checking for writeability of
	-tmpdir value because no default directory can be guaranteed to be
	writeable.

	* tests/autoMkindex.tcl: removed.
	* tests/pkg/samename.tcl: removed.
	* tests/pkg/magicchar.tcl: removed.
	* tests/pkg/magicchar2.tcl: removed.
	* tests/autoMkindex.test: Updated auto_mkIndex tests to use [makeFile]
	and [removeFile] so tests are done in [temporaryDirecotry] where write
	access is guaranteed.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Fixed [makeFile] and [viewFile] to
	* tests/cmdAH.test:		accurately reflect a file's contents.
	* tests/event.test:		Updated tests that depended on buggy
	* tests/http.test:		behavior.  Also added warning messages
	* tests/io.test:		to "-debug 1" operations to debug test
	* tests/iogt.test:		calls to (make|remove)(File|Directory).

	* unix/mkLinks: `make mklinks` on 6-27 commits.

2002-06-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.h: modified the macro TclEmitPush to not call its
	first argument repeatedly or pass it to other macros, [Bug 575194]
	reported by Peter Spjuth.

2002-06-28  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* docs/tcltest.n:	Doc revisions in progress.
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Corrected -testdir default value. Was
	not reliable, and disagreed with docs! Thanks to Hemang Lavana. [Bug
	575150]

2002-06-28  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:	Renamed the Tcl_Platform* #defines to
	* unix/tclUnixPipe.c:	TclOS* because they are only used
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:	internally.  Also stopped double-#def
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:	of TclOSlstat [Bug 566099, post-rename]
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c:
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:

	* doc/string.n: Improved documentation for [string last] along lines
	described in [Bug 574799] so it indicates that the supplied index
	marks the end of the search space.

2002-06-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/dde.n:		Work in progress updating the documentation
	* doc/http.n:		of the packages that come bundled with
	* doc/msgcat.n:		the Tcl source distribution, notably tcltest.
	* doc/registry.n:
	* doc/tcltest.n:

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Made sure that the TCLTEST_OPTIONS
	environment variablle configures tcltest at package load time.

2002-06-26  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fix to handling of empty paths "" which are not
	claimed by any filesystem [Bug 573758]. Ensure good error messages are
	given in all cases.
	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: fix to bug reported as part of [Patch 566669].
	Thanks to Taguchi, Takeshi for the report.

2002-06-26  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: Make [clock format] respect locale settings.
	* tests/clock.test:   [Bug 565880]. ***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***

2002-06-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/CrtInterp.3:
	* doc/StringObj.3: clarifications by Don Porter, [Bugs 493995, 500930]

2002-06-24  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Corrected suppression of -verbose skip
	* tests/tcltest.test:		and start by [test -output]. Also
	corrected test suite errors exposed by corrected code. [Bug 564656]

2002-06-25  Reinhard Max  <max@suse.de>

	* unix/tcl.m4:	     New macro SC_CONFIG_MANPAGES.
	* unix/configure.in: Added support for symlinks and compression
	* unix/Makefile.in:  when installing the manpages. [Patch 518052]
	* unix/mkLinks.tcl:  Default is still hardlinks and no compression.

	* unix/mkLinks:	     generated
	* unix/configure:

	* unix/README:	     Added documentation for the new features.

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_PATH_TCLCONFIG): Replaced ${exec_prefix}/lib by
	${libdir}.

2002-06-25  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetIntForIndex): Fix of critical [Bug 533364]
	generated when the index is bad and the result is a shared object. The
	T_ASTO(T_GOR, ...) idiom likely exists elsewhere though. Also removed
	some cruft that just complicated things to no advantage.
	(SetEndOffsetFromAny): Same fix, though this wasn't on the path
	excited by the bug.

2002-06-24  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Implementation of TIP 101.  Adds
	* tests/parseOld.test:		and exports a [configure] command
	* tests/tcltest.test:		from tcltest.

2002-06-22  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: updated changes file for 8.4b1 release.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Corrections to tcltest and the
	* tests/basic.test:		Tcl test suite so that a test
	* tests/cmdInfo.test:		with options -constraints knownBug
	* tests/compile.test:		-limitConstraints 1 only tests the
	* tests/encoding.test:		knownBug tests. Mostly involves
	* tests/env.test:		replacing direct access to the
	* tests/event.test:		testConstraints array with calls
	* tests/exec.test:		to the testConstraint command
	* tests/execute.test:		(which requires tcltest version 2)

	* win/README.binary, README, win/configure.in, unix/configure.in:
	* generic/tcl.h (TCL_RELEASE_*, TCL_PATCH_LEVEL): Bump to beta1.

2002-06-21  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c:
	* generic/tclParseExpr.c: LogSyntaxError() should reset the
	interpreter result [Bug 550142 "Tcl_ExprObj -> abort"]

2002-06-21  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in:	Updated all package install directories to
	* win/Makefile.in:	match current Major.minor versions of the
	* win/makefile.bc:	packages. Added tcltest package to
	* win/makefile.vc:	installation on Windows.

	* library/init.tcl:  Corrected comments and namespace style issues.
	Thanks to Bruce Stephens. [Bug 572025]

2002-06-21  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/cmdAH.test:	     Added TIP#99 implementation of 'file
	* tests/fCmd.test:	     link'. Supports creation of symbolic and
	* tests/fileName.test:	     hard links in the native filesystems and
	* tests/fileSystem.test:     in vfs's, when the individual filesystem
	* generic/tclTest.c:	     supports the concept.
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* doc/file.n:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: Also enhanced speed of 'file normalize' on Windows

2002-06-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (TclEvalObjvInternal): fix for [Bug 571385] in
	the implementation of TIP#62 (command tracing). Vince Darley, Hemang
	Lavana & Don Porter: thanks.

2002-06-20  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj): clarified and simplified the
	logic for compilation/recompilation.

2002-06-19  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n: Fixed indentation.  No substantive changes.

2002-06-19  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegexpObjCmd): get the resultPtr again as
	the Tcl_ObjSetVar2 may cause the result to change.
	[Patch 558324] (watson)

2002-06-19  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC): removing unused "for(;;)" loop;
	improved comments; re-indentation.

2002-06-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC):
	- elimination of duplicated code in the non-immediate INST_INCR
	  instructions.
	- elimination of 103 (!) TclDecrRefCount macros. The different
	  instructions now jump back to a common "DecrRefCount zone" at the
	  top of the loop. The macro "ADJUST_PC" was replaced by two macros
	  "NEXT_INST_F" and "NEXT_INST_V" that take three params
	  (pcAdjustment, # of stack objects to discard, resultObjPtr handling
	  flag). The only instructions that retain a TclDecrRefCount are
	  INST_POP (for speed), the common code for the non-immediate
	  INST_INCR, INST_FOREACH_STEP and the two INST_LSET.

	The object size of tclExecute.o was reduced by approx 20% since the
	start of the consolidation drive, while making room for some peep-hole
	optimisation at runtime.

2002-06-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TEBC, INST_DONE): small bug in the panic code
	for tcl-stack corruption.

2002-06-17  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	Trims to support the removal of RESOURCE_INCLUDED from rc scripts from
	[FRQ 565088].

	* generic/tcl.h: moved the #ifndef RC_INVOKED start block up in the
	file. rc scripts don't need to know thread mutexes.

	* win/tcl.rc:
	* win/tclsh.rc: removed the #define RESOURCE_INCLUDED to let the
	built-in -DRC_INVOKED to the work.

2002-06-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/CrtTrace.3:	 Added TIP#62 implementation of command
	* doc/trace.n:		 execution tracing [FRQ 462580] (lavana).
	* generic/tcl.h:	 This includes enter/leave tracing as well
	* generic/tclBasic.c:	 as inter-procedure stepping.
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclVar.c:
	* tests/trace.test:

2002-06-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinPipe.c (BuildCommandLine): Fixed [bug 554068] ([exec] on
	windows did not treat { in filenames well.). Bug reported by Vince
	Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>, patch provided by Vince
	too.

2002-06-17  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: #ifdef logic for K&R C backwards compatibility
	changed to assume modern C by default. See [FRQ 565088] for full
	details.

2002-06-17  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/msgcat.n: Corrected en_UK references to en_GB. UK is not a
	country designation recognized in ISO 3166.

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:  More Windows Registry locale codes from
	Bruno Haible.

	* doc/msgcat.n:
	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* tests/msgcat.test:  Revised locale initialization to interpret
	environment variable locale values according to XPG4, and to recognize
	the LC_ALL and LC_MESSAGES values over that of LANG. Also added many
	Windows Registry locale values to those recognized by msgcat. Revised
	tests and docs. Bumped to version 1.3. Thanks to Bruno Haible for the
	report and assistance crafting the solution. [Bug 525522, 525525]

2002-06-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileTokens): a better algorithm for the
	previous bug fix.

2002-06-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompile.c (TclCompileTokens):
	* tests/compile.test: [Bug 569438] in the processing of dollar
	variables; report by Georgios Petasis.

2002-06-16  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: bug in the consolidation of the INCR_..._STK
	instructions; the bug could not be exercised as the (faulty)
	instruction INST_INCR_ARRAY_STK was never compiled-in (related to [Bug
	569438]).

2002-06-14  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): runtime peep-hole
	optimisation of variables (INST_STORE, INST_INCR) and commands
	(INST_INVOKE); faster check for the existence of a catch.
	(TclExecuteByteCode): runtime peep-hole optimisation of comparisons.
	(TclExecuteByteCode): runtime peep-hole optimisation of INST_FOREACH -
	relies on peculiarities of the code produced by the bytecode compiler.

2002-06-14  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/rules.vc: The test for compiler optimizations was in error.
	Thanks goes to Roy Terry <royterry@earthlink.net> for his assistance
	with this.

2002-06-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/trace.n, tests/trace.test:
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TraceObjCmd,TclTraceCommandObjCmd)
	(TclTraceVariableObjCmd): Changed references to "trace list" to "trace
	info" as mandated by TIP#102.

2002-06-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): consolidated code for the
	conditional branch instructions.

2002-06-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): fixed the previous
	patch - wouldn't compile with TCL_COMPILE_DEBUG set.

2002-06-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): consolidated the handling
	of exception returns to INST_INVOKE and INST_EVAL, as well as most of
	the code for INST_CONTINUE and INST_BREAK, in the new jump target
	"processExceptionReturn".

2002-06-13  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): consolidated variable
	handling opcodes, replaced redundant code with some 'goto'. All
	store/append/lappend opcodes on the same data type now share the main
	code; same with incr opcodes.
	* generic/tclVar.c: added the bit TCL_TRACE_READS to the possible
	flags to Tcl_SetVar2Ex - it causes read traces to be fired prior to
	setting the variable. This is used in the core for [lappend].

	***NOTE*** the usage of TCL_TRACE_READS in Tcl_(Obj)?GetVar.* is not
	documented; there, it causes the call to create the variable if it
	does not exist. The new usage in Tcl_(Obj)?SetVar.* remains
	undocumented too ...

2002-06-13  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/fCmd.test:
	* tests/winFile.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c: fixed up further so both compiles and actually
	works with VC++ 5 or 6.
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWin32Dll.c: cleaned up code and vfs tests and added tests for
	the internal changes of 2002-06-12, to see whether WinTcl on NTFS can
	coexist peacefully with links in the filesystem. Added new test
	command 'testfilelink' to enable the newer code to be tested.
	* tests/fCmd.test: (made certain tests of 'testfilelink' not run on
	unix).

2002-06-12  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteTrace): fixed [Bug 568123] (thanks to
	Hemang Lavana)

2002-06-12  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinFile.c: corrected the symbolic link handling code to
	allow it to compile. Added real definition of REPARSE_DATA_BUFFER
	(found in winnt.h). Most of the added definitions appear to have
	correct, cross-Win-version equivalents in winnt.h and should be
	removed, but just making things "work" for now.

2002-06-12  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tclDecls.h: made code for Tcl_FSNewNativePath agree with man
	pages.

	* doc/FileSystem.3: clarified the circumstances under which certain
	functions are called in the presence of symlinks.

	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinPort.h:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:  Fix for Windows to allow 'file lstat', 'file
	type', 'glob -type l', 'file copy', 'file delete', 'file normalize',
	and all VFS code to work correctly in the presence of symlinks
	(previously Tcl's behaviour was not very well defined). This also
	fixes possible serious problems in all versions of WinTcl where 'file
	delete' on a NTFS symlink could delete the original, not the symlink.
	Note: symlinks cannot yet be created in pure Tcl.

2002-06-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: reverted the new compilation functions; replaced
	by a more general approach described below.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.c: made *all* compiled variable access attempts
	create an indexed variable - even get or incr without previous set.
	This allows indexed access to local variables that are created and set
	at runtime, for example by [global], [upvar], [variable], [regexp],
	[regsub].

2002-06-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/global.n:
	* doc/info.n:
	* test/info.test:
	* generic/tclCmdIL.c: fix for [Bug 567386], [info locals] was
	reporting some linked variables.

	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: added compile functions for [global], [variable]
	and [upvar]. They just declare the new local variables, the commands
	themselves are not compiled-in. This gives a notably faster read
	access to these linked variables.

2002-06-11  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: optimised algorithm for exception range
	lookup; part of [Patch 453709].

2002-06-10  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c: fixed [Bug 566669]
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: improved and sped up handling of native paths
	(duplication and conversion to normalized paths), particularly on
	Windows.
	* modified part of above commit, due to problems on Linux. Will
	re-examine bug report and evaluate more closely.

2002-06-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test:  More corrections to test suite so that tests of
	failing [test]s don't show up themselves as failing tests.

2002-06-07  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Tidied up headers in relation to float.h to
	cut the cruft and ensure DBL_MAX is defined since doubles seem to be
	the same size everywhere; if the assumption isn't true, the variant
	platforms had better have run configure...

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h (EOVERFLOW): Added code to define it if it wasn't
	previously defined. Also some other general tidying and adding of
	comments. [Bugs 563122, 564595]
	* compat/tclErrno.h: Added definition for EOVERFLOW copied from
	Solaris headers; I've been unable to find any uses of EFTYPE, which
	was the error code previously occupying the slot, in Tcl, or any
	definition of it in the Solaris headers.

2002-06-06  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/dltest/Makefile.in: Remove hard coded CFLAGS=-g and add
	CFLAGS_DEBUG, CFLAGS_OPTIMIZE, and CFLAGS_DEFAULT varaibles. [Bug
	565488]

2002-06-06  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/tcltest.test:  Corrections to test suite so that tests of
	failing [test]s don't show up themselves as failing tests.

	* tests/io.test: Fixed up namespace variable resolution issues
	revealed by running test suite with "-singleproc 1".

	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* tests/tcltest.test: Several updates to tcltest.
	  1) changed to lazy initialization of test constraints
	  2) deprecated [initConstraintsHook]
	  3) repaired badly broken [limitConstraints].
	  4) deprecated [threadReap] and [mainThread]
	[Patch 512214, Bug 558742, Bug 461000, Bug 534903]

2002-06-06  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c (TclpReaddir, TclpLocaltime, TclpGmtime):
	added mutex wrapped calls to readdir, localtime & gmtime in case their
	thread-safe *_r counterparts are not available.
	* unix/tcl.m4: added configure check for readdir_r
	* unix/tcl.m4 (Darwin): set TCL_DEFAULT_ENCODING to utf-8 on MacOSX
	(where posix file apis expect utf-8, not iso8859-1).
	* unix/configure: regen
	* unix/Makefile.in: set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH in parallel to
	LD_LIBRARY_PATH for MacOSX dynamic linker.
	* generic/tclEnv.c (TclSetEnv): fix env var setting on MacOSX. Adapted
	from [Patch 524352] (jkbonfield).

2002-06-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Tcl_Main.3: Documented $tcl_rcFileName and added more
	clarifications about the intended use of Tcl_Main(). [Bug 505651]

2002-06-05  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (TclGlob): mac specific fix to recent changes
	in 'glob -tails' handling.
	* mac/tclMacPort.h:
	* mac/tclMacChan.c: fixed TIP#91 bustage.
	* mac/tclMacResource.c (Tcl_MacConvertTextResource): added utf
	conversion of text resource contents.
	* tests/macFCmd.test (macFCmd-1.2): allow CWIE creator.

2002-06-04  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* tests/init.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test:	Added more TIP 85 tests from Arjen Markus.
	Converted tcltest.test to use a private namespace. Fixed bugs in
	[tcltest::Eval] revealed by calling [tcltest::test] from a non-global
	namespace, and namespace errors in init.test.

2002-06-04  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update msys+mingw URL.

2002-06-03  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl:
	* tests/tcltest.test:  Implementation of TIP 85. Allows tcltest users
	to add new legal values of the -match option to [test], associating
	each with a Tcl command that does the matching of expected results
	with actual results of tests. Thanks to Arjen Markus. => tcltest 2.1
	[Patch 521362]

2002-06-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/namespace.n: added description of [namepace forget] behaviour
	for unqualified patterns [Bug 559268]

2002-06-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: reverting an accidental modification in the
	last commit.

2002-06-03  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Tcl.n: clarify the empty variable name issue ([Bug 549285]
	reported by Tom Krehbiel, patch by Don Porter).

2002-05-31  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/package.tcl:	Fixed leak of slave interp in [pkg_mkIndex].
	Thanks to Helmut for report. [Bug 550534]

	* tests/io.test:
	* tests/main.test:  Use the "stdio" constraint to control whether an
	[open "|[interpreter]"] is attempted.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclMathInProgress,TclExecuteByteCode
	(ExprCallMathFunc):
	* generic/tclInt.h (TclMathInProgress):
	* unix/Makefile.in (tclMtherr.*):
	* unix/configure.in (NEED_MATHERR):
	* unix/tclAppInit.c (matherr):
	* unix/tclMtherr.c (removed file):
	* win/tclWinMtherr.c (_matherr): Removed internal routine
	TclMathInProgress and Unix implementation of matherr(). These are now
	obsolete, dealing with very old versions of the C math library.
	Windows version is retained in case Borland compilers require it, but
	it is inactive. Thanks to Joe English. [Bug 474335, Patch 555635]
	* unix/configure: regen

2002-05-30  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompExpr.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.c:
	* generic/tclCompile.h: removed exprIsJustVarRef and
	exprIsComparison from the ExprInfo and CompileEnv structs. These were
	set, but not used since dec 1999 [Bug 562383].

2002-05-30  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c (TclGlob): fix to longstanding 'knownBug' in
	fileName tests 15.2-15.4, and fix to a new Tcl 8.4 bug in certain uses
	of 'glob -tails'.
	* tests/fileName.test: removed 'knownBug' flag from some tests, added
	some new tests for above bugs.

2002-05-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure: regen'ed
	* unix/configure.in: replaced bigendian check with autoconf standard
	AC_C_BIG_ENDIAN, which defined WORDS_BIGENDIAN on bigendian systems.
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharNcmp):
	* generic/tclInt.h (TclUniCharNcmp): use WORDS_BIGENDIAN instead of
	TCL_OPTIMIZE_UNICODE_COMPARE to enable memcmp alternative.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode INST_STR_CMP):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): changed the case for choosing
	the Tcl_UniCharNcmp compare to when both objs are of StringType, as
	benchmarks show that is the optimal check (both bigendian and
	littleendian systems).

2002-05-29  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c: Removed "dummy" reference to Tcl_LinkVar. It is
	no longer needed since Tcl_Main() now actually calls Tcl_LinkVar().
	Thanks to Joe English for pointing that out.

2002-05-29  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode):
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): Use the macro version.
	* generic/tclInt.h (TclUniCharNcmp): Optimised still further with a
	macro for use in sensitive places like tclExecute.c

	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharNcmp): Use new flag to figure out when
	we can use an optimal comparison scheme, and default to the old scheme
	in other cases which is at least safe.
	* unix/configure.in (TCL_OPTIMIZE_UNICODE_COMPARE): New optional flag
	that indicates when we can use memcmp() to compare Unicode strings
	(i.e. when the high-byte of a Tcl_UniChar precedes the low-byte.)

2002-05-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* generic/tclUtf.c: added TclpUtfNcmp2 private command that mirrors
	Tcl_UtfNcmp, but takes n in bytes, not utf-8 chars. This provides a
	faster alternative for comparing utf strings internally.
	(Tcl_UniCharNcmp, Tcl_UniCharNcasecmp): removed the explicit end of
	string check as it wasn't correct for the function (by doc and logic).

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_StringObjCmd): reworked the string equal
	comparison code to use TclpUtfNcmp2 as well as short-circuit for equal
	objects or unequal length strings in the equal case. Removed the use
	of goto and streamlined the other parts.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode): added check for object
	equality in the comparison instructions. Added short-circuit for !=
	length strings in INST_EQ, INST_NEQ and INST_STR_CMP. Reworked
	INST_STR_CMP to use TclpUtfNcmp2 where appropriate, and only use
	Tcl_UniCharNcmp when at least one of the objects is a Unicode obj with
	no utf bytes.

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): removed error creation
	in code that no longer throws an error.

	* tests/string.test:
	* tests/stringComp.test: added more string comparison checks.

	* tests/clock.test: better qualified 9.1 constraint check for %s.

2002-05-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (TclpRealloc, TclpFree): protect against
	the case when NULL is based.

	* tests/clock.test: added clock-9.1
	* compat/strftime.c:
	* generic/tclClock.c:
	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* unix/tclUnixTime.c: fix for Windows msvcrt mem leak caused by using
	an env(TZ) setting trick for in clock format -gmt 1. This also makes
	%s seem to work correctly with -gmt 1 as well as making it a lot
	faster by avoid the env(TZ) hack. TclpStrftime now takes useGMT as an
	arg. [Bug 559376]

2002-05-28  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: fixes to Tcl_FSLoadFile when called on a file
	inside a vfs. This should avoid leaving temporary files sitting around
	on exit. [Bug 545579]

2002-05-27  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* win/tclWinError.c: Added comment on conversion of
	ERROR_NEGATIVE_SEEK because that is a mapping that really belongs, and
	not a catch-all case.
	* win/tclWinPort.h (EOVERFLOW): Should be either EFBIG or EINVAL
	* generic/tclPosixStr.c (Tcl_ErrnoId, Tcl_ErrnoMsg): EOVERFLOW can
	potentially be a synonym for EINVAL.

2002-05-24  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	=== Changes due to TIP#91 ===

	* win/tclWinPort.h: Added declaration of EOVERFLOW.
	* doc/CrtChannel.3: Added documentation of wideSeekProc.
	* generic/tclIOGT.c (TransformSeekProc, TransformWideSeekProc):
	Adapted to use the new channel mechanism.
	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (FileSeekProc, FileWideSeekProc): Renamed
	FileSeekProc to FileWideSeekProc and created new FileSeekProc which
	has the old-style interface and which errors out with EOVERFLOW when
	the returned file position can't fit into the return type (int for
	historical reasons.)
	* win/tclWinChan.c (FileSeekProc, FileWideSeekProc): Renamed
	FileSeekProc to FileWideSeekProc and created new FileSeekProc which
	has the old-style interface and which errors out with EOVERFLOW when
	the returned file position can't fit into the return type (int for
	historical reasons.)
	* mac/tclMacChan.c (FileSeek): Reverted to old interface; Macs lack
	large-file support because I can't see how to add it.
	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_Seek, Tcl_Tell): Given these functions
	knowledge of the new arrangement of channel types.
	(Tcl_ChannelVersion): Added recognition of new version code.
	(HaveVersion): New function to do version checking.
	(Tcl_ChannelBlockModeProc, Tcl_ChannelFlushProc)
	(Tcl_ChannelHandlerProc): Made these functions use HaveVersion for
	ease of future maintainability.
	(Tcl_ChannelBlockModeProc): Obvious lookup function.
	* generic/tcl.h (Tcl_ChannelType): New wideSeekProc field, and
	seekProc type restored to old interpretation.
	(TCL_CHANNEL_VERSION_3): New channel version.

2002-05-24  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/winPipe.test: Applied patch for [Bug 549617]. Patch and bug
	report by Kevin Kenny <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>.

	* win/tclWinSock.c (TcpWatchProc): Fixed [Bug 557878]. We are not
	allowed to mess with the watch mask if the socket is a server socket.
	I believe that the original reporter is George Peter Staplin.

2002-05-21  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in: Invoke SC_ENABLE_SHARED before calling
	SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS so that the SHARED_BUILD variable can be checked
	inside SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Pass -non_shared instead of -shared
	to ld when configured with --disable-shared under OSF. [Bug 540390]

2002-05-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: added prototype for TclpFilesystemPathType().
	* mac/tclMacChan.c: use MSL provided creator type if available instead
	of the default 'MPW '.

2002-05-16  Joe English  <jenglish@users.sf.net>

	* doc/CrtObjCmd.3: Added Tcl_GetCommandFromObj, Tcl_GetCommandFullName
	[Bugs 547987, 414921]

2002-05-14  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TtyOutputProc): #if/#endif-ed this function out
	to stop compiler warnings. Also much general tidying of comments in
	this file and removal of whitespace from blank lines.

2002-05-13  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (SETBREAK): Solaris thinks ioctl() takes a signed
	second argument, and Linux thinks ioctl() takes an unsigned second
	argument. So need a longer definition of this macro to get neither to
	spew warnings...

2002-05-13  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEvent.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h: clean up all memory allocated by the filesystem,
	via introduction of 'TclFinalizeFilesystem'. Move TclFinalizeLoad into
	TclFinalizeFilesystem so we can be sure it is called at just the right
	time. Fix bad comment also. [Bug 555078 and 'fs' part of 543549]
	* win/tclWinChan.c: fix comment referring to wrong function.

2002-05-10  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/load.test:
	* tests/safe.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test: Corrected some list-quoting issues and other
	matters that cause tests to fail when the patch includes special
	characters. Report from Vince Darley. [Bug 554068].

2002-05-08    David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* doc/file.n:
	* tools/man2tcl.c:
	* tools/man2help2.tcl: Thanks to Peter Spjuth <peter.spjuth@space.se>,
	again. My prior fix for single-quote macro mis-understanding was
	wrong. Reverted to reimpliment the 'macro2' proc which handles
	single-quote macros and restored file.n text arrangement to avoid
	single-quotes on the first line. Sorry for all the confusion.

2002-05-08  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/man2tcl.c:
	* tools/man2help2.tcl: Proper source of macro error mis-understanding
	single-quote as the leading macro command found and repaired.

	* doc/file.n: Reverted to prior state before I messed with it.

2002-05-08  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Corrected [uplevel] quoting when
	[source]-ing test script in subdirectories.
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/load.test:
	* tests/main.test:
	* tests/tcltest.test:
	* tests/unixInit.test: Fixes to test suite when there's a space in the
	working path. Thanks to Kevin Kenny.

2002-05-07  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	-- Changes from Peter Spjuth <peter.spjuth@space.se>
	* tools/man2tcl.c: Increased line buffer size and a bail-out if that
	should ever be over-run.
	* tools/man2help.tcl: Include Courier New font in rtf header.
	* tools/man2help2.tcl: Improved handling of CS/CE fields. Use Courier
	New for code samples and indent better.

	* doc/file.n:
	* doc/TraceCmd.3:  winhelp conversion tools where understanding a ' as
	the first character on a line to be an unknown macro. Not knowing how
	to repair tools/man2tcl.c, I decided to rearrange the text in the docs
	instead.

2002-05-07  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: fix to similar segfault when using
	'glob -types nonsense -dir dirname -join * *'. [Bug 553320]

	* doc/FileSystem.3: further documentation on vfs.
	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* tests/pkgMkindex.test: Fix to testsuite bugs when running out of
	directory whose name contains '{' or '['.

2002-05-07  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/basic.test: Fix for [Bug 549607]
	* tests/encoding.test: Fix for [Bug 549610]
	These are testsuite bugs that caused failures when the filename
	contained spaces. Report & fix by Kevin Kenny.

2002-05-02  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclFileName.c: fix to freeing a bad object (i.e. segfault)
	when using 'glob -types nonsense -dir dirname'.
	* generic/tclWinFile.c: fix to [Bug 551306], also wrapped some long
	lines.
	* tests/fileName.test: added several tests for the above bugs.
	* doc/FileSystem.3: clarified documentation on refCount requirements
	of the object returned by the path type function.
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c: moved TclpFilesystemPathType to the platform
	specific directories, so we can add missing platform-specific
	implementations. On Windows, 'file system' now returns useful results
	like "native NTFS", "native FAT" for that system. Unix and MacOS still
	only return "native".
	* doc/file.n: clarified documentation.
	* tests/winFile.test: test for 'file system' returning correct values.
	* tests/fileSystem.test: test for 'file system' returning correct
	values. Clean up after failed previous test run.

2002-04-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: change HP-11 SHLIB_LD_LIBS from "" to ${LIBS} so that
	the .sl knows its dependent libs.

2002-04-26  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/obj.test (obj-11.[56]): Test conversion to boolean more
	thoroughly.
	* generic/tclObj.c (SetBooleanFromAny): Was not calling an integer
	parsing function on native 64-bit platforms! [Bug 548686]

2002-04-24  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclInt.h: corrected TclRememberJoinableThread decl to use
	VOID instead of void.
	* generic/tclThreadJoin.c: noted that this code isn't needed on Unix.

2002-04-23  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/exec.n:
	* doc/tclvars.n: doc updates [Patch 509426] (gravereaux)

2002-04-24  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacResource.r: added check of TCLTK_NO_LIBRARY_TEXT_RESOURCES
	#define to allow disabling the inclusion of the tcl library code in
	the resource fork of Tcl executables and shared libraries.

2002-04-23  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/TraceCmd.3: New file that documents Tcl_CommandTraceInfo,
	Tcl_TraceCommand and Tcl_UntraceCommand [Bug 414927]

2002-04-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclAlloc.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclThreadAlloc.c (new):
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c:
	* win/Makefile.in:
	* win/tclWinInt.h:
	* win/tclWinThrd.c: added new threaded allocator contributed by AOL
	that significantly reduces lock contention when multiple threads are
	in use. Only Windows and Unix implementations are ready, and the
	Windows one may need work. It is only used by default on Unix for now,
	and requires that USE_THREAD_ALLOC be defined (--enable-threads on
	Unix will define this).

	* generic/tclIOUtil.c (Tcl_FSRegister, Tcl_FSUnregister): corrected
	calling of Tcl_ConditionWait to ensure that there would be a condition
	to wait upon.

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FileObjCmd): added cast in FILE_SIZE.

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoDeleteFile): check return of setattr API calls
	in file deletion for correct Win32 API handling.

	* win/Makefile.in: correct dependencies for shell, gdb, runtest
	targets.

	* doc/clock.n:
	* compat/strftime.c (_fmt): change strftime to correctly handle
	localized %c, %x and %X on Windows. Added some notes about how the
	other values could be further localized.

2002-04-19  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main): Free the memory allocated for the
	startup script path. [Bug 543549]

	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl: [mcmax] wasn't using the caller's
	namespace when determining the max translated length. Also made
	revisions for better use of namespace variables and more efficient
	[uplevel]s.

	* doc/msgcat.n:
	* library/msgcat/msgcat.tcl:
	* library/msgcat/pkgIndex.tcl:	Added [mcload] to the export list of
	msgcat; bumped to 1.2.3. [Bug 544727]

2002-04-20  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.decls:
	* generic/tclIntPlatDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c:
	* mac/tclMacFCmd.c:
	* mac/tclMacFile.c:
	* mac/tclMacUtil.c: Modified TclpObjNormalizePath to be alias file
	aware, and replaced various calls to FSpLocationFrom*Path by calls to
	new alias file aware versions FSpLLocationFrom*Path. The alias file
	aware routines don't resolve the last component of a path if it is an
	alias. This allows [file copy/delete] etc. to act correctly on alias
	files. (c.f. discussion in [Bug 511666])

2002-04-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/lindex.test (lindex-3.7):
	* generic/tclUtil.c (TclGetIntForIndex): Stopped indexes from hitting
	wide ints. [Bug 526717]

2002-04-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c:
	* tests/info.test: [Bug 545325] info level didn't report namespace
	eval, bug report by Richard Suchenwirth.

2002-04-18  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/subst.n:	Clarified documentation on handling unusual return
	codes during substitution, and on variable substitutions implied by
	command substitution, and vice versa. [Bug 536838]

2002-04-18  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tclCmdIL.c (InfoBodyCmd):
	* tests/info.test (info-2.6): Proc bodies without string reps would
	report as empty [Bug 545644]

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj): More clarification for comment on
	behaviour when substitutions are not well-formed, prompted by [Bug
	536831]; alas, removing the ill-defined behaviour is a lot of work.

2002-04-18  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* tests/expr-old.test: fix for [Bug 542588] (Phil Ehrens), where "too
	large integers" were reported as "floating-point value" in [expr]
	error messages.

2002-04-17  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c (EscapeFromUtfProc):
	* generic/tclIO.c (WriteChars, Tcl_Close): corrected the handling of
	outputting end escapes for escape-based encodings.
	[Bug 526524] (yamamoto)

2002-04-17  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n:  Removed [saveState] and [restoreState] from tcltest
	2 documentation, effectively deprecating them. [Bug 495660]
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: Made separate export for commands kept
	only for tcltest 1 compatibility.

	* tests/iogt.test: Revised to run tests in a namespace, rather than
	use the useless and buggy [saveState] and [restoreState] commands of
	tcltest. Updated to use tcltest 2 as well. [Patch 544911]

2002-04-16  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: Revised to run tests in a namespace, rather than use
	the useless and buggy [saveState] and [restoreState] commands of
	tcltest. Updated to use tcltest 2 as well. [Patch 544546]

2002-04-15  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclProc.c:
	* tests/proc-old.test: Improved stack trace for TCL_BREAK and
	TCL_CONTINUE returns from procs. [Bug 536955] (dgp)

	* generic/tclExecute.c:
	* tests/compile.test: made bytecodes check for a catch before
	returning; the compiled [return] is otherwise non-catchable. [Bug
	542142] reported by Andreas Kupries.

2002-04-15  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/socket.test:  Increased timeout values so that tests have time
	to successfully complete even on slow/busy machines. [Bug 523470]

	* doc/tcltest.n:
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* tests/tcltest.test:  Revised [tcltest::test] to return errors when
	called with invalid syntax and to accept exactly two arguments as
	documented. Improved error messages. [Bug 497446, Patch 513983]
	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***: Incompatible with previous
	tcltest 2.* releases, found only in alpha releases of Tcl 8.4.

2002-04-11  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclNotify.c (TclFinalizeNotifier): remove remaining
	unserviced events on finalization.

	* win/tcl.m4: Enabled COFF as well as CV style debug info with
	--enable-symbols to allow Dr. Watson users to see function info. More
	info on debugging levels can be obtained at:
	http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnvc60/html/gendepdebug.asp

	* tests/ioCmd.test: fixed iocmd-8.15 to have mac and unixPc variants.

	* generic/tclParse.c (Tcl_ParseVar): conditionally incr obj refcount
	to prevent possible mem leak.

2002-04-08  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.h: no <sys/types.h> on mac.
	* mac/tclMacFile.c: minor fixes to Vince's changes from 03-24.
	* mac/tclMacOSA.c:
	* mac/tclMacResource.c: added missing Tcl_UtfToExternalDString
	conversions of resource file names.
	* mac/tclMacSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc): fixed bug introduced by Andreas
	on 02-25; changed strcmp's to strncmp's so that option comparison
	behaves like on other platforms.
	* mac/tcltkMacBuildSupport.sea.hqx (CW Pro6 changes): added support to
	allow Tk to hookup C library stderr/stdout to TkConsole.
	* tests/basic.test:
	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* tests/encoding.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test:
	* tests/ioCmd.test: fixed tests failing on mac: check for existence of
	[exec], changed some result strings.

2002-04-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c (Realpath): added a little extra code to
	initialize a realpath arg when compiling in PURIFY mode in order to
	prevent spurious purify warnings. We should really create our own
	realpath implementation, but this will at least quiet purify for now.

2002-04-05  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_SubstObj):
	* tests/subst.test:  Corrected [subst] so that return codes TCL_BREAK
	and TCL_CONTINUE returned by variable substitution have the same
	effect as when those codes are returned by command substitution. [Bug
	536879]

2002-04-03  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl: added getMatchingFiles back (alias
	to GetMatchingFiles), which was a public function in tcltest 1.0.

2002-04-01  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEnv.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: invalidate filesystem cache when the user
	changes env(HOME). Fixes [Bug 535621]. Also cleaned up some of the
	documentation.
	* tests/fileSystem.test: added test for bug just fixed.

2002-04-01  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* win/tclWinTime.c (Tcl_GetTime): made the checks of clock frequency
	more permissive to cope with the fact that Win98SE is observed to
	return 1.19318 in place of 1.193182 for the performance counter
	frequency.

2002-03-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_TraceObjCmd, TraceVarProc)
	(TraceCommandProc, TclTraceCommandObjCmd):  corrected potential
	double-free of traces on variables by flagging in Trace*Proc that it
	will free the var in case the eval wants to delete the var trace as
	well. [Bug 536937]
	Also converted Tcl_UntraceVar -> Tcl_UntraceVar2 and Tcl_Eval to
	Tcl_EvalEx in Trace*Proc for slight efficiency improvement.

2002-03-29  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/AllowExc.3:
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjv,Tcl_EvalEx,Tcl_EvalObjEx):
	* generic/tclCompile.h (TclCompEvalObj):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj,TclExecuteByteCode):
	* tests/basic.test: Corrected problems with Tcl_AllowExceptions having
	influence over the wrong scope of Tcl_*Eval* calls. Patch from Miguel
	Sofer. Report from Jean-Claude Wippler. [Bug 219181]

2002-03-28  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclVar.c: Refactored CallTraces to collect repeated handling
	of its returned value into CallTraces itself.

2002-03-28  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/feather.bmp:
	* tools/man2help.tcl:
	* tools/man2help2.tcl:
	* win/makefile.vc: More winhelp target fixups. Added a feather bitmap
	to the non-scrollable area and changed the color to be yellow from a
	plain white. The colors can be whatever we want them to be, but
	thought I would start with something bold. [Bug 527941]

	* doc/SetVar.3:
	* doc/TraceVar.3:
	* doc/UpVar.3: .AP macro syntax repair.

2002-03-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* tools/man2help.tcl:
	* win/makefile.vc:  winhelp target now copies all needed files from
	tools/ to a workarea under $(OUT_DIR) and builds it from there.	No
	build cruft is left in tools/ anymore. All paths used in man2help.tcl
	are now relative to where the script is. [Bug 527941]

2002-03-27  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/.cvsignore:
	* win/buildall.vc.bat:
	* win/coffbase.txt:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/nmakehlp.c (new):
	* win/rules.vc: First draft fix for [Bug 527941]. More changes need to
	done to the makehelp target to get to stop leaving build files in the
	tools/ directory. This does not address the syntax errors in the man
	files. Having the contents of tcl.hpj(.in) inside makefile.vc allows
	for version numbers to be replaced with macros.

	The new nmakehlp.c is built by rules.vc in preprocessing and removes
	the need to use tricky shell syntax that wasn't compatible on Win9x
	systems.  Clean targets made Win9x complient.  This is a first draft
	repair for [Bug 533862].

2002-03-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx): passing the correct commandSize
	to TclEvalObjvInternal. [Bug 219362], fix by David Knoll.

2002-03-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx):
	* tests/basic.test: avoid exceptional returns at level 0
	[Bug 219181]

2002-03-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/tcltest.n ([mainThread]):
	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* tests/tcltest.test:  Major code cleanup to deal with whitespace,
	coding conventions, and namespace issues, with several minor bugs
	fixed in the process.

	* tests/main.test: Added missing [after cancel]s.

2002-03-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/main.test: Removed workarounds for Bug 495977.

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Keep the value of $::auto_path
	unchanged, so that the tcltest package can test code that depends
	on auto-loading. If a testing application needs $::auto_path pruned,
	it should do that itself. [Bug 495726]
	Improve the processing of the -constraints option to [test] so that
	constraint lists can have arbitrary whitespace, and non-lists don't
	blow things up. [Bug 495977]
	Corrected faulty variable initialization. [Bug 534845]

2002-03-25  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/CrtTrace.3: small doc correction
	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_DeleteTrace): Allow NULL callback on
	trace deletions [Bug 534728] (Hemang Lavana).

2002-03-24  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjv): replaced obscure, incorrect
	code as described in [Bug 533907] (Don Porter).

2002-03-24  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Use [interpreter] to set/query the
	executable currently running the tcltest package. [Bug 454050]

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:	Allow non-proc commands to be used
	as the customization hooks. [Bug 495662]

2002-03-24  Vince Darley  <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/file.n:
	* tests/cmdAH.test:
	* tests/fileName.test:
	* tests/fileSystem.test: (new file)
	* tests/winFCmd.test: fix [Bug 511666] and [Bug 511658], and improved
	documentation of some aspects of the filesystem, particularly
	'Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory' which now might match a single file/directory
	only, and 'file normalize' which wasn't very clear before. Removed
	inconsistency betweens docs and the Tcl_Filesystem structure. Also
	fixed [Bug 523217] and corrected file normalization on Unix so that it
	expands symbolic links. Added some new tests of the filesystem code
	(in the new file 'fileSystem.test'), and some extra tests for correct
	handling of symbolic links. Fix to [Bug 530960] which shows up on
	Win98. Made comparison with ".com" case insensitive in tclWinPipe.c

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***: But only between alpha releases
	(users of the new Tcl_Filesystem lookup table in Tcl 8.4a4 need to
	handle the new way in which Tcl may call Tcl_FSMatchInDirectory, and
	'file normalize' on unix now behaves correctly). Only known impact is
	with the 'tclvfs' extension.

2002-03-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/basic.test (basic-46.1): adding test for [Bug 533758], fixed
	earlier today.

2002-03-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinInt.h: moved undef of TCL_STORAGE_CLASS. [Bug 478579]

2002-03-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalObjEx):
	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclCompEvalObj): fixed the errorInfo for
	return codes other than (TCL_OK, TCL_ERROR) to runLevel 0 [Bug
	533758]. Removed the static RecordTracebackInfo(), as its
	functionality is easily replicated by Tcl_LogCommandInfo. Bug and
	redundancy noted by Don Porter.

2002-03-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/expr.n: Improved documentation for ceil and floor [Bug 530535]

	[Patch 532642]
	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h: make genstubs

2002-03-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	reported in bug 530320.

2002-03-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (ESP, EBP, DoRenameFile, DoCopyFile,
	(_except_dorenamefile_handler, _except_docopyfile_handler): Implement
	SEH support under gcc using inline asm. Tcl and Tk should now compile
	with Mingw 1.1. [Patch 525746]

2002-03-14  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, DoCopyFile): Handle an SEH exception
	with EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER instead of restarting the faulting
	instruction with EXCEPTION_CONTINUE_EXECUTION. Bug 466102 provides an
	example of how restarting could send Tcl into an infinite loop. [Patch
	525746]

2002-03-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, DoCopyFile, DoDeleteFile,
	(DoRemoveJustDirectory): Make sure we don't pass NULL or "" as a path
	name to Win32 API functions since this was crashing under Windows 98.

2002-03-11  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl:
	* library/tcltest/pkgIndex.tcl: Bumped tcltest package to 2.0.2.

2002-03-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/tcltest/tcltest.tcl (getMatchingFiles): Pass a proper list
	to foreach to avoid munging a Windows patch like D:\Foo\Bar into
	D:FooBar before the glob.

2002-03-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclEncoding.c: Fix typo in comment.
	* generic/tclIO.c (DoReadChars, ReadBytes, ReadChars): Use NULL value
	instead of pointer set to NULL to make things more clear. Reorder
	arguments so that they match the function signatures. Cleanup little
	typos and add more descriptive comment.

2002-03-08  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/README: Update to indicate that Mingw 1.1 is required to build
	Tcl. Add section describing new msys based build process. Update
	Cygwin build instructions so users know where to find Mingw 1.1.

2002-03-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoCopyFile): correctly set retval to TCL_OK.

2002-03-07  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c (TclpCheckStackSpace):
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c (DoRenameFile, DoCopyFile): Replace hard coded
	constants with Win32 symbolic names. Move control flow statements out
	of __try blocks since the documentation indicates it is frowned upon.

2002-03-07  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/interp.n:
	* generic/tclInterp.c (Tcl_InterpObjCmd,SlaveObjCmd,
	(SlaveRecursionLimit):
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* tests/interp.test: Added the [interp recursionlimit] command to
	set/query the recursion limit of an interpreter.  Proposal and
	implementation from Stephen Trier. [TIP 87, Patch 522849]

2002-03-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.h, tools/tcl.wse.in, unix/configure.in,
	* unix/tcl.spec, win/README.binary, win/configure.in, README:
	Bumped patchlevel; this might need to change in the future, but it
	will help us distinguish between the CVS version and the most
	recent released version.

2002-03-06  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h: for unshared objects, TclDecrRefCount now frees
	the internal rep before the string rep - just like the non-macro
	Tcl_DecrRefCount/TclFreeObj [Bug 524802].

2002-03-06  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/lsearch.n: Documentation of new features, plus examples.
	* tests/lsearch.test: Tests of new features.

	http://purl.org/tcl/tip/80 for details.

2002-03-05  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	*** 8.4a4 TAGGED FOR RELEASE ***

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: initial remedy for [Bug 525783] flush problem
	introduced by TIP #35. This may not satisfy true serial channels, but
	it restores the correct flushing of std* channels on exit.

	* unix/README: added --enable-langinfo doc.

	* unix/tcl.spec:
	* tools/tcl.wse.in: fixed URL refs to use www.tcl.tk or SF.

2002-03-04  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* README:
	* mac/README:
	* unix/Makefile.in:
	* unix/README:
	* win/README:
	* win/README.binary: updated to use www.tcl.tk URL.

	* unix/Makefile.in: added older ChangeLogs to dist target.

	* tests/io.test:
	* tests/encoding.test: corrected iso2022 encoding results.
	added encoding-24.*
	* generic/tclEncoding.c (EscapeFromUtfProc): corrected output of
	escape codes as per RFC 1468. [Patch 474358] (taguchi)
	(TclFinalizeEncodingSubsystem): corrected potential double-free
	when encodings were finalized on exit. [Bug 219314, 524674]

2002-03-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* library/encoding/iso2022-jp.enc:
	* library/encoding/iso2022.enc:
	* tools/encoding/iso2022-jp.esc:
	* tools/encoding/iso2022.esc: gave <ESC>$B precedence over <ESC>$@,
	based on comments (point 1) in [Bug 219283] (RFC 1468)

	* tests/encoding.test: added encoding-23.* tests
	* generic/tclIO.c (FilterInputBytes): reset the TCL_ENCODING_START
	flags in the ChannelState when using 'gets'. [Bug 523988]
	Also reduced the value of ENCODING_LINESIZE from 30 to 20 as this
	seems to improve the performance of 'gets' according to tclbench.

2002-02-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (TraceCommandProc): ensure that TraceCommandInfo
	structure was also deleted when a command was deleted to prevent a
	mem leak.

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_CreateObjTrace): set tracePtr->flags
	correctly.

	* generic/tclTimer.c (TimerExitProc): remove remaining events in
	tls on thread exit.

2002-02-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclNamesp.c: allow cached fully-qualified namespace names to
	be usable from different namespaces within the same interpreter
	without forcing a new lookup [Patch 458872].

2002-02-28  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclExecute.c: Replaced a few direct stack accesses with the
	POP_OBJECT() macro [Bug 507181] (Don Porter).

2002-02-27  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/GetIndex.3:
	* generic/tcl.decls (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct):
	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct):  Revised the
	prototype of the Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct to take its struct
	table as a (CONST VOID *) argument, better describing what it is,
	maintaining source compatibility, and adding CONST correctness
	according to TIP 27.  Thanks to Joe English for an elegant
	solution. [Bug 520304]

	* generic/tclDecls.h: make genstubs

	* generic/tclMain.c (Tcl_Main,StdinProc):  Corrected some reference
	count management errors on the interactive command Tcl_Obj found by
	Purify. Thanks to Jeff Hobbs for the report and assistance.

2002-02-27  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalTokensStandard): corrected mem leak
	in error case.

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestStatProc[123]): correct harmless UMRs.

	* generic/tclLink.c (Tcl_LinkVar): correct mem leak in error case.

2002-02-27  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/socket.test (2.7): Accepted and applied patch for [Bug 523470]
	provided by Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net> to avoid timing
	problems in that test.

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (TclpOpenFileChannel): Added code to regonize
	"/dev/tty" (by name) and to not handle it as tty / serial line. This
	is the controlling terminal and is special. Setting it into raw mode
	as is done for other tty's is a bad idea. This is a hackish fix for
	expect [Bug 520624]. The fix has limitation: Tcl_MakeFileChannel
	handles tty's specially too, but is unable to recognize /dev/tty as it
	only gets a file descriptor, and no name for it.

2002-02-26  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (StoreStatData): corrected mem leak.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): prevent obj leak in remedial
	regsub case.

	* generic/tclFileName.c (Tcl_TranslateFileName): decr refcount for
	error case to prevent mem leak.

	* generic/tclVar.c (Tcl_ArrayObjCmd): removed extra obj allocation.

	* unix/tclUnixSock.c (Tcl_GetHostName): added an extra gethostbyname
	check to guard against failure with truncated names returned by uname.

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_SERIAL_PORT): added sys/modem.h check and defined
	_XOPEN_SOURCE_EXTENDED for HP-11 to get updated header decls.

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c: added Unix implementation of TIP #35, serial
	port support. [Patch 438509] (schroedter)

2002-02-26  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCmpCmds.c: (bugfix to the bugfix, hopefully the last)
	Bugfix to the new [for] compiling code: was setting a exceptArray
	parameter using another param which wasn't yet initialised, thus
	filling it with noise.

2002-02-25  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacSock.c (TcpGetOptionProc): Changed to recognize the option
	"-error". Essentially ignores the option, always returning an empty
	string.

2002-02-25  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* doc/Alloc.3:
	* doc/LinkVar.3:
	* doc/ObjectType.3:
	* doc/PkgRequire.3:
	* doc/Preserve.3:
	* doc/TCL_MEM_DEBUG.3: Updated documentation to describe the ckalloc,
	ckfree, ckrealloc, attemptckalloc, and attemptckrealloc macros, and
	to accurately describe when and how they are used. [Bug 497459] (dgp)

	* generic/tclHash.c (AllocArrayEntry, AllocStringEntry): Before
	invoking ckalloc when creating a Tcl_HashEntry, check that the amount
	of memory being allocated is at least as large as
	sizeof(Tcl_HashEntry). The previous code was allocating memory regions
	that were one or two bytes short. [Bug 521950] (dejong)

2002-02-25  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclBasic.c (Tcl_EvalEx): avoiding a buffer overrun reported
	by Joe English, and restoring tcl7.6 behaviour for [subst]: badly
	terminated nested scripts will raise an error and not be evaluated.
	[Bug 495207]

2002-02-25  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: corrected strtoll prototype mismatch on Tru64.
	* compat/strtod.c (strtod): simplified #includes
	* compat/strtol.c (strtol): gather result in a long before returning
	as a long: necessary on platforms where sizeof(int) != sizeof(long).

2002-02-25  Daniel Steffen  <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclLoadDyld.c: updated to use Mac OS X 10.1 dyld APIs that have
	more libdl-like semantics. [Bug 514392]

2002-02-25  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds: fixing a bug in patch dated 2002-02-22, in the
	code for [for] and [while]. Under certain conditions, for long bodies,
	the exception range parameters were badly computed. Tests forthcoming:
	I still can't reproduce the conditions in the testsuite (!), although
	the bug (with assorted segfault or panic!) can be triggered from the
	console or with the new parse.bench in tclbench.

2002-02-25  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* compat/strtoul.c, compat/strtol.c, compat/strtod.c: Added UCHAR,
	CONST and #includes to clean up GCC output.

2002-02-23  Don Porter  <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* compat/strtoull.c (strtoull):
	* compat/strtoll.c (strtoll):
	* compat/strtoul.c (strtoul): Fixed failure to handle leading sign
	symbols '+' and '-' and '0X' and raise overflow errors. [Bug 440916]
	Also corrects prototype and errno problems.

2002-02-23  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* configure: Regen.
	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_CONFIG_CFLAGS): Link with -n32 instead of -32 when
	building on IRIX64-6.* system. [Bug 521707]

2002-02-22  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclObj.c: renamed global variable emptyString ->
	tclEmptyString because it is no longer static.
	* generic/tclPkg.c: Fix for panic when library is loaded on a
	platform without backlinking without proper use of stubs. [Bug 476537]

2002-02-22  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/regexpComp.test: updated regexp-11.[1-4] to match changes
	in regexp.test for new regsub syntax

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added --enable-64bit support for AIX-4 (using -q64
	flag) when using IBM's xlc compiler.

	* tests/safe.test: updated safe-8.5 and safe-8.7
	* library/safe.tcl (CheckFileName): removed the limit on
	sourceable file names (was only *.tcl or tclIndex files with no
	more than one dot and 14 chars).  There is enough internal
	protection in a safe interpreter already.  Fixes [Tk Bug 521560].

2002-02-22  Miguel Sofer  <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclCompCmds: [FR 465811]. Optimising [if], [for] and
	[while] for constant conditions; in addition, [for] and [while] are
	now compiled with the "loop rotation" optimisation (thanks to Kevin
	Kenny).

2002-02-22  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	--- TIP#76 CHANGES ---
	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): Final-argument-less
	[regsub] returns the modified string.
	* doc/regsub.n: Updated docs.
	* tests/regexp.test: Updated and added tests.

	* compat/strtoll.c (strtoll):
	* compat/strtoull.c (strtoull):
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* win/tclWinPort.h: Const-ing 64-bit compatability declarations.
	Note that the return pointer is non-const because it is entirely
	legal for the functions to be called from somewhere that owns the
	string being passed.  Fixes problem reported by Larry Virden.

2002-02-21  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/mkd.bat (removed):
	* win/coffbase.txt (new):
	* win/makefile.bc:
	* win/makefile.vc:  Changed the 'setup' target to stop using the
	mkd.bat file and just make the directory right in the rule. Same
	change to makefile.bc. configure.in nor Makefile.in use it.

	coffbase.txt will be the master list for our "prefered base addresses"
	set by the linker. This should improve load-time (NT only) by avoiding
	relocations. Submissions to the list by extension authors are
	encouraged.

	Added a 'tidy' target to compliment 'clean' and 'hose' to remove just
	the outputs. Also removed the $(winlibs) macro as it wasn't being
	used.

	Stuff left to do:
	1) get the winhelp target to stop building in the tools/ directory.
	2) stop using rmd.bat
	3) add more dependacy rules.

	* win/tclAppInit.c: Reverted back to -r1.6, as the header file change
	to tclPort.h won't allow for easy embedded support outside of the
	source dist. Thanks to Don Porter for pointing this out to me.

2002-02-21  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc: Added a new "loimpact" option that sets the
	-ws:aggressive linker option. Off by default. It's said to keep the
	heap use low at the expense of alloc speed.

	* win/tclAppInit.c: Changed #include "tcl.h" to be tclPort.h to remove
	the raw windows.h include. tclPort.h brings in windows.h already and
	lessens the pre-compiled-header mush and the randomly useless #pragma
	comment (lib,...) references throughout the big windows.h tree (as
	observed at high linker warning levels).

2002-02-21  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.h: Better guessing of LP64/ILP32 architecture, but
	now sensitive to presence of (suitable) <limits.h>

2002-02-20  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls (Tcl_RegExpRange,Tcl_GetIndexFromObjStruct):
	Overlooked a few source incompatibilities.  Now using CONST84.
	* generic/tclDecls.h: make genstubs
	* generic/tcl.h (Tcl_CmdObjTraceProc): silence warning from Sun
	Workshop compiler.

2002-02-20  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/buildall.vc.bat:
	* win/makefile.vc:
	* win/rules.vc: General clean-ups. Added compiler and linker tests for
	a) the pentium 0x0F errata, b) optimizing (not all have this), and c)
	linker v6 section alignment confusion. All these are tested first to
	make sure any D4002 or LNK1117 warnings aren't displayed. The pentium
	0x0F errata is a recommended switch. The v5 linker's section alignment
	default is 512, but the v6 linker was changed to 4096 in an attempt to
	speed loading on Win98. I changed the default to always be 512 across
	both linkers, unless linking statically, then 4096 is used for the
	claimed speed effect. Using a 512 alignment saves 12k bytes of dead
	space in the DLL.

	Added IA64 B-stepping errata switch when the compiler supports it.

	Added profiling to $(lflags) when requested and also removed the
	explict -entry option as the default works fine as is.

	Removed win/tclWinInit.c from the special case section to let it use
	the common implicit rule as the $(EXTFLAGS) macro it had was never
	referenced anywhere.

2002-02-20  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* generic/tcl.h: Added code to guess the correct settings for
	TCL_WIDE_INT_IS_LONG and TCL_WIDE_INT_TYPE when configure doesn't tell
	us them, as can happen with extensions.

2002-02-19  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* doc/format.n: Updated docs to list the specification.
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_FormatObjCmd): Made behaviour on 64-bit
	platforms correctly meet the specification, that %d works with the
	native word-sized integer, instead of trying to guess (wrongly) from
	the value being passed.

2002-02-19  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* changes: First draft of updated changes for 8.4a4 release.

2002-02-15  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h: add strtoll/strtoull declarations for platforms
	that do not define them.

	* generic/tclIndexObj.c (STRING_AT): removed ptrdiff_t cast and use of
	VOID* in default case (GNU-ism).

2002-02-15  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* compat/strtoll.c:
	* compat/strtoul.c:
	* compat/strtoull.c:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c:
	* generic/tclPosixStr.c:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* generic/tclTestObj.c:
	* tests/get.test:
	* win/Makefile.vc: Further tweaks to the TIP 72 patch to make it
	compile under VC++.

2002-02-15  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tclExecute.c:
	* tclIOGT.c:
	* tclIndexObj.c: Touchups to the TIP 72 patch to make it compileable
	under Windows again. The changes are not complete, there is one nasty
	regarding _stati64

2002-02-15  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	+----------------------+
	| TIP #72 IMPLEMENTED. |
	+----------------------+

	There are a lot of changes from this TIP, so please see
	http://tip.tcl.tk/72.html for discussion of backward-compatability
	issues, but the main ones modifications are in:

	* generic/tcl.h: New types.
	* generic/tcl.decls: New public functions.
	* generic/tclExecute.c: 64-bit aware bytecode engine.
	* generic/tclBinary.c: 64-bit handling in [binary] command.
	* generic/tclScan.c: 64-bit handling in [scan] command.
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c: 64-bit handling in [file] and [format]
	commands.
	* generic/tclBasic.c: New "wordSize" entry in ::tcl_platform.
	* generic/tclFCmd.c: Large-file support (with many consequences.)
	* generic/tclIO.c: Large-file support (with many consequences.)
	* compat/strtoll.c, compat/strtoull.c: New support functions.
	* unix/tcl.m4, unix/configure: 64-bit support and greatly enhanced
	cacheing.

	Most other changes, including all those in doc/* and test/* as well as
	the majority in the platform directories, follow on from these.

	Also coming out of the woodwork:
	* generic/tclIndex.c: Better support for Cray PVP.
	* win/tclWinMtherr.c: Better Borland support.

	Note that, in a number of places through the Unix part of the platform
	support, there are Tcl_Platform* references. These are expanded into
	the correct way to call that particular underlying function, i.e. with
	or without a '64' suffix, and should be used by people working on the
	core in preference to the API functions they overlay so that the code
	remains portable depending on the presence or absence of 64-bit
	support on the underlying platform.

	***POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY***: Extracted from the TIP

	SUMMARY OF INCOMPATIBILITIES AND FIXES
	======================================

	The behaviour of expressions containing constants that appear positive
	but which have a negative internal representation will change, as
	these will now usually be interpreted as wide integers. This is always
	fixable by replacing the constant with int(constant).

	Extensions creating new channel types will need to be altered as
	different types are now in use in those areas. The change to the
	declaration of Tcl_FSStat and Tcl_FSLstat (which are the new preferred
	API in any case) are less serious as no non-alpha releases have been
	made yet with those API functions.

	Scripts that are lax about the use of the l modifier in format and
	scan will probably need to be rewritten. This should be very uncommon
	though as previously it had absolutely no effect.

	Extensions that create new math functions that take more than one
	argument will need to be recompiled (the size of Tcl_Value changes),
	and functions that accept arguments of any type (TCL_EITHER) will need
	to be rewritten to handle wide integer values. (I do not expect this
	to affect many extensions at all.)

2002-02-14  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_GetsObjCmd): Trivial fix for [Bug 517503], a
	memory leak reported by Miguel Sofer <msofer@users.sourceforge.net>.
	The leak happens if an error occurs for "set var [gets $chan]" and
	leak one empty object.

2002-02-12  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* djgpp/ (new directory)
	* djgpp/Makefile (new):
	* unix/tclAppInit.c:
	* unix/tclMtherr.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFCmd.c:
	* unix/tclUnixFile.c:
	* unix/tclUnixInit.c:
	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:  Early stage of DJGPP support for building Tcl
	on DOS. Dynamic loading isn't working, yet. Requires watt32 for the
	TCP/IP stack. No autoconf, yet. Barely tested, but makes a working exe
	that runs Tcl in protected-mode, flat memory. [exec] and pipes will
	need the most work as multi-tasking on DOS has to be carefully.

2002-02-10  Kevin Kenny  <kennykb@acm.org>

	* doc/CrtObjCmd.3:
	* doc/CrtTrace.3:
	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c:
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclTest.c:
	* tests/basic.test: Added Tcl_CreateObjTrace,
	Tcl_GetCommandInfoFromToken and Tcl_SetCommandInfoFromToken.
	(TIPs #32 and #79.)

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: Regenerated Stubs tables.

2002-02-08  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* unix/configure:
	* unix/tcl.m4: added -pthread for FreeBSD to EXTRA_CFLAGS and
	LDFLAGS.  Also triggered nodots only for FreeBSD-3.
	Added AC_DEFINE(_POSIX_PTHREAD_SEMANTICS) for Solaris.

	* unix/tclUnixPort.h:
	* unix/tclUnixThrd.c: added thread-safe versions of readdir,
	localtime, gmtime and inet_ntoa for threaded build. (jgdavidson)

	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd): prevented ckfree being
	called on a pointer to NULL.

	* win/tclWin32Dll.c:
	* win/tclWinFCmd.c:
	* win/tclWinFile.c:
	* win/tclWinInit.c: Partial TIP 27 rollback.  Following routines
	restored to return (char *): Tcl_DStringAppend,
	Tcl_DStringAppendElement, Tcl_JoinPath, Tcl_TranslateFileName,
	Tcl_ExternalToUtfDString, Tcl_UtfToExternalDString,
	Tcl_UniCharToUtfDString, Tcl_GetCwd, Tcl_WinTCharToUtf. Also
	restored Tcl_WinUtfToTChar to return (TCHAR *) and
	Tcl_UtfToUniCharDString to return (Tcl_UniChar *).  Modified
	some callers.  This change recognizes that Tcl_DStrings are
	de-facto white-box objects.

	* generic/tclDecls.h:
	* generic/tclPlatDecls.h: make genstubs

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c: corrected use of C++-style comment.

2002-02-06  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/scan.test:
	* generic/tclScan.c (Tcl_ScanObjCmd): corrected scan 0x... %x handling
	that didn't accept the 0x as a prelude to a base 16 number. [Bug
	495213]

	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileRegexpCmd): made early check
	for bad RE to stop checking further.

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegsubObjCmd): added special case to
	search for simple 'string map' style regsub calls.
	Delayed creation of resultPtr object until an initial match is
	made, as the input string object can then be reused for no matches.
	(Tcl_StringObjCmd): optimization improvements to the STR_MAP
	algorithm for zero-length and nocase cases.

	* tests/regexp.test:
	* tests/regexpComp.test: extra code coverage tests.

	* tests/string.test: added 10.18 and 10.19 extra tests.

	* generic/regc_locale.c (casecmp): slight performance improvement.

2002-02-05  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* library/http/http.tcl:
	* library/http/pkgIndex.tcl:  Corrected use of http::error when
	::error was intended.  Bump to http 2.4.2.

2002-02-04  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclUnixChan.c (FileOutputProc): Fixed [bug 465765] reported by
	Dale Talcott <daletalcott@users.sourceforge.net>. Avoid writing
	nothing into a file as STREAM based implementations will consider this
	a EOF (if the file is a pipe). Not done in the generic layer as this
	type of writing is actually useful to check the state of a socket.

	* doc/open.n: Fixed [Bug 511540], added cross-reference to 'pid' as
	the command to use to retrieve the pid of a command pipeline created
	via 'open'.

2002-02-01  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* generic/tclCmdMZ.c (Tcl_RegexpObjCmd): handle quirky about case
	earlier to avoid shimmering problem.

2002-02-01  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* tests/io.test: io-39.22 split into two tests, one platform
	dependent, the other not. -eofchar is not empty on the windows
	platform.

2002-02-01  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclTest.c: fix to picky windows compiler problem with the
	'MainLoop' function declaration.

2002-01-31  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinFCmd.c: TIP 27: Applied patch fixing CONST warnings on
	behalf of Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>.

2002-01-30  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tcl.decls:
	* generic/tcl.h:
	* generic/tclInt.h: For each interface identified in the TIP 27
	changes below as a POTENTIAL INCOMPATIBILITY, the source of the
	incompatibility has been parameterized so that it can be removed. When
	compiling extension code against the Tcl header files, use the
	compiler flag -DUSE_NON_CONST to remove the irresolvable source
	incompatibilities introduced by the TIP 27 changes. Resolvable changes
	are left for extension authors to resolve.
	* generic/tclDecls.h: make genstubs

2002-01-30  Vince Darley <vincentdarley@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3: added documentation for 3 public functions which
	had been overlooked. Fixes [Bug 507701]
	* unix/mkLinks: make mklinks

2002-01-29  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* tests/regexpComp.test:
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileRegexpCmd): enhanced to support
	-nocase and -- options.

2002-01-28  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tcl.m4 (SC_LOAD_TCLCONFIG):
	* win/tcl.m4 (SC_LOAD_TCLCONFIG): Set TCL_LIB_SPEC, TCL_STUB_LIB_SPEC,
	and TCL_STUB_LIB_PATH to the values of TCL_BUILD_LIB_SPEC,
	TCL_BUILD_STUB_LIB_SPEC, and TCL_BUILD_STUB_LIB_PATH when tclConfig.sh
	is loaded from the build directory. A Tcl extension should make use of
	the non-build versions of these variables since they will work in both
	cases. This modification was described in TIP #34.

2002-01-28  Jeff Hobbs  <jeffh@ActiveState.com>

	* win/tclWinReg.c (regConnectRegistryProc,RecursiveDeleteKey)
	(DeleteKey,GetKeyNames,GetType,GetValue,OpenSubKey,SetValue):
	redid the CONSTification as previous changes caused failing tests.

	* tests/regexpComp.test (new):
	* generic/tclInt.h:
	* generic/tclBasic.c: added TclCompileRegexpCmd entry
	* generic/tclCompCmds.c (TclCompileStringCmd): corrected to return
	TCL_OUT_LINE_COMPILE instead of TCL_ERROR for parsing errors, so
	it only throws the error for runtime compile, in case the user
	modifies 'string'.
	(TclCompileRegexpCmd): first try at a byte-compiled regexp
	command.  It handles static strings and ^$ bounded static strings.
	(TclCompileAppendCmd): made TclPushVarName call always use
	TCL_CREATE_VAR as numWords is always > 2 at that point.

	* generic/tclExecute.c (TclExecuteByteCode:INST_LIST): correct

	Make -eofchar and -translation options read only for server sockets.
	[Bug 496733]

	* generic/tclIO.c (Tcl_GetChannelOption, Tcl_SetChannelOption):
	Instead of returning nothing for the -translation option on a server
	socket, always return "auto". Return the empty string enclosed in
	quotes for the -eofchar option on a server socket. Fixup -eofchar
	usage message so that it matches the implementation.
	* tests/io.test: Add -eofchar tests and -translation tests to ensure

2002-01-21  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIO.c (WriteChars): Fix for [Bug 506297], reported by
	Martin Forssen <ruric@users.sourceforge.net>. The encoding chosen in
	the script exposing the bug writes out three intro characters when
	TCL_ENCODING_START is set, but does not consume any input as
	TCL_ENCODING_END is cleared. As some output was generated the
	enclosing loop calls UtfToExternal again, again with START set. Three
	more characters in the out and still no use of input ... To break this
	infinite loop we remove TCL_ENCODING_START from the set of flags after
	the first call (no condition is required, the later calls remove an
	unset flag, which is a no-op). This causes the subsequent calls to
	UtfToExternal to consume and convert the actual input.

2002-01-17  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* generic/tclIOCmd.c (Tcl_GetsObjCmd): Fixed [Bug 504642] as reported
	by Brian Griffin <bgriffin@users.sourceforge.net>, using his patch.
	Before the patch the generic I/O layer held an unannounced reference
	to the interp result to store the read line into. This unfortunately
	has disastrous results if the channel driver executes a Tcl script to
	perform its operation, this freeing the interp result. In that case we
	are dereferencing essentially a dangling reference. It is not truly
	dangling because the object is in the free list, but this only causes
	us to smash the free list and have the error occur later somewhere
	else. The patch simply creates a new object for the line and later
	sets it into the interp result when we are done with reading.

	generic/tclInt.h (renamed to TclEolTranslation). It is not used
	anywhere in Tcl's public interface.

	* unix/configure: Regen.
	* unix/configure.in:
	* win/configure: Regen.
	* win/configure.in: Use ${libdir} instead of ${exec_prefix}/lib
	to properly support the --libdir option to configure. [Bug 489370]

2002-01-11  Andreas Kupries  <andreas_kupries@users.sourceforge.net>

	* win/tclWinSerial.c (SerialSetOptionProc): Applied patch for [Bug
	500348] supplied by Rolf Schroedter <schroedter@users.sf.net>. The
	function modified the contents of the the 'value' string and now does
	not do this anymore. This is a followup to the change made on
	2001-12-17.

2002-01-11  David Gravereaux <davygrvy@pobox.com>

	* win/makefile.vc: Removed -GD compiler option. It was intended for
	future use, but MS is again changing the future at their whim. The
	D4002 warning was harmless though, but someone using VC .NET logged it
	as a concern. [Bug 501565]

2002-01-11  Mo DeJong  <mdejong@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/Makefile.in: Burn Tcl build directory into tcltest executable
	to avoid crashes caused by ld loading a previously installed version
	of the tcl shared library. [Bug 218110]

	Kevin Kenny <kennykb@users.sourceforge.net>

	* unix/tclLoadDld.c (TclpLoadFile):  syntax error: unbalanced parens.
	Kevin notes that it's far from clear that this file is ever included
	in an actual build; Linux without dlopen appears to be a nonexistent
	configuration.

	* generic/tclTest.c (MainLoop):
	* tests/main.test (Tcl_Main-1.{3,4,5,6}):  Corrected some non-portable
	tests from the new Tcl_Main changes.  Thanks to Kevin Kenny.

	casts to satisfy picky compilers.

	* generic/tclMain.c:  Bug fix: neglected the NULL case in
	TclGetStartupScriptFileName().	Broke Tk/wish.

2002-01-05  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/Tcl_Main.3:
	* generic/tclMain.c:  Substantial rewrite and expanded documentation
	of Tcl_Main to correct a number of bugs and flaws:

		* Interactive Tcl_Main can now enter a main loop, exit that
		  loop and continue interactive operations. The loop may even
		  exit in the midst of interactive command typing without loss
		  of the partial command. [Bugs 486453, 474131]
		* Tcl_Main now gracefully handles deletion of its master
		  interpreter.
		* Interactive Tcl_Main can now operate with non-blocking stdin
		* Interactive Tcl_Main can now detect EOF on stdin even in
		  mid-command.	[Bug 491341]
		* Added VFS-aware internal routines for managing the startup
		  script selection.
		* Tcl variable 'tcl_interactive' is now linked to C variable
		  'tty' so that one can disable/enable interactive prompts at
		  the script level when there is no startup script. This is
		  meant for use by the test suite.
		* Consistent use of the Tcl libraries standard channels as
		  returned by Tcl_GetStdChannel(); as opposed to the channels
		  named 'stdin', 'stdout', and 'stderr' in the master interp,
		  which can be different or unavailable.
		* Tcl_Main now calls Tcl_Exit() if evaluation of [exit] in the
		  master interpreter returns, assuring Tcl_Main does not
		  return.
		* Documented Tcl_Main's absence from public stub table
		* Documented that Tcl_Main does not return.
		* Documented Tcl variables set by Tcl_Main.
		* All prompts are done from a single procedure, Prompt.
		* Use of Tcl_Obj-enabled interfaces everywhere.

	* generic/tclInt.decls (TclGetStartupScriptPath,
	(TclSetStartupScriptPath): New internal VFS-aware routines for
	managing the startup script of Tcl_Main.
	* generic/tclIntDecls.h:
	* generic/tclStubInit.c: make genstubs

	* generic/tclTest.c (TestsetmainloopCmd,TestexitmainloopCmd,
	(Tcltest_Init,TestinterpdeleteCmd):
	* tests/main.test (new):  Added new file to test suite that thoroughly
	tests generic/tclMain.c; added some new test commands for testing
	Tcl_SetMainLoop().

	* generic/tclThreadJoin.c (TclRememberJoinableThread,TclJoinThread):
	Replaced Tcl_Alloc and Tcl_Free calls with ckalloc and ckfree so that
	memory debugging is supported.

2002-01-04  Daniel Steffen <das@users.sourceforge.net>

	* mac/tclMacTime.c (TclpGetTZName): fix for daylight savings TZName
	bug

2002-01-03  Don Porter <dgp@users.sourceforge.net>

	* doc/FileSystem.3:
	* generic/tclIOUtil.c: Updated some old uses of "fileName" to new VFS
	terminology, "pathPtr".

2002-01-03  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/basic.test (basic-39.4): Greatly simplified test while still
	leaving it so that it crashes when run without the fix to the
	[foreach] implementation.
	* generic/tclCmdAH.c (Tcl_ForeachObjCmd): Stopped [Bug 494348] from
	happening by not trying to be so clever with cacheing; if nothing
	untoward is happening anyway, the less efficient technique will only
	add a few instruction cycles (one function call and a few
	derefs/assigns per list per iteration, with no change in the number of
	tests) and if something odd *is* going on, the code is now far more
	robust.

	* tests/basic.test (basic-39.4): Reproducable script from [Bug 494348]

2002-01-02  Donal K. Fellows  <fellowsd@cs.man.ac.uk>

	* tests/util.test (Wrapper_Tcl_StringMatch,util-5.*): Rewrote so the
	test is performed with the right internal function since [string
	match] no longer uses Tcl_StringCaseMatch internally.

	* tests/string.test (string-11.51):
	* generic/tclUtf.c (Tcl_UniCharCaseMatch):
	* generic/tclUtil.c (Tcl_StringCaseMatch): Fault with matching
	case-insensitive non-ASCII patterns containing upper case characters.
	[Bug 233257]
