Subject: [Metakit] Instructions for Legacy Pythons

Hi,

Below are instructions for people needing to build the python metakit wrapper
for non-latest python versions.

With the web app framework I'm building, I was using SQLObject for database
storage. But given the fact that most public web hosts offering Python have
version 2.1 or earlier, I've decided life is easiest for all if my framework can
be made to work with python1.5.2 or later.

These simple instructions walk people through the building of the Mk4py.so
module for Python 1.5.2 or later, and can be used to help people compile a
binary Mk4py.so locally, and drop it (with metakit.py) into their web hosting
file tree.

The need for this comes from the fact that, while most reasonable public web
hosts support python, most of these have python1.5.2 or python2.1, and no
Metakit.

I hope the metakit devs might see fit to include these instructions in
Metakitreleases.

Cheers David

INSTRUCTIONS FOR BUILDING AND USING METAKIT ON EARLY PYTHON VERSIONS

1. PREPARATION

cd into top-level Metakit directory, then:

 $ mkdir buildsx.x

 (here and below we use 'x.x' to mean the python version you want to build for,
eg '1.5')

2. PRE-CONFIGURATION

cd into the 'unix' directory, then:

 $ cp configure configurex.x

Then, edit configurex.x, search for the 'case "$with_python in' line. Look down
a bit, and change the PY_INCLUDE_DIR and PY_LIB_DIR lines, to reference the
version of python you're building for

3. CONFIGURE AND BUILD

cd into the buildsx.x directory, and type:

 $ ../pythonx.x/configurex.x --with-python=/usr

 (If your python doesn't live in /usr, change to /usr/local or wherever)

 $ make

4. INSTALLATION

While still in your buildsx.x directory, type:

 $ cp Mk4py.so /usr/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages

 (you may need /usr/local/lib instead /usr/lib)

Then, cd into the python directory:

 $ cd ../python

Note that you can build Metakit Mk4py.so for Python 1.5.2, and use it quite
happily in all later python versions. However, you will probably want to
suppress the API warning. To do this, edit the metakit.py file, and add the
following lines right after the docstring:

 import warnings warnings.filterwarnings('ignore', '.*Mk4py.*', RuntimeWarning)

Then, just copy metakit.py into your python load path:

 $ cp metakit.py /usr/lib/pythonx.x/site-packages

 (change /usr/lib to /usr/local/lib or whatever if needed)

5. TESTING

Start up your chosen python interpreter:

 $ pythonx.x

And verify that you can load Metakit:

 >>> from metakit import *
