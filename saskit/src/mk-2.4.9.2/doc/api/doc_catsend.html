MetaKit sample code - CatSend</h2><br clear=left>

<p>This application is a simple TCP/IP client based on Winsock. </p>

<p><b>What it does</b>: CatSend allows you to select a datafile and to
transmit its contents over a TCP/IP connection. Although CatSend can handle
any MetaKit datafile, only the catalog files created by DisCat will make
sense to the receiving program called &quot;CatRecv&quot; (see below).
By altering the address shown on the screen, you can transfer the data
across the network to any other machine on Internet running CatRecv...
this is only a demonstration of what can be done, this serves no useful
purpose whatsoever. </p>

<p><b>What it illustrates</b>: CatSend illustrates how to work with MetaKit
datafiles of which the structure is unknown or only partially known. Since
CatSend doesn't care, this program will continue to work even if DisCat
and CatRecv are modified to use a different data structure on file. </p>

<p><b>How to use it</b>: CatSend only makes sense in combination with Catrecv
and DisCat. To try it out, you should first create a catalog file with
DisCat which you can then pick up with CatSend. Note that like any typical
client-server application, the CatRecv server application must be running
before using CatSend to open a connection. Apart from selecting a datafile
and transmitting it to CatRecv, the CatSend application is pretty boring.
The &quot;interesting&quot; source code is less than 10 lines long... </p>

<p><b>Known problems</b>: None, but since CatSend uses Winsock, you need
to have a correctly installed version of the TCP/IP protocol stack (such
as the one that comes with Windows 95). </p>

<p>You do not need an active network connection or any network hardware,
since every TCP/IP installation can select local communication by using
&quot;localhost&quot; as a host name (i.e. IP address 127.0.0.1). If you
obtained this package from Internet via FTP, then you should be all set,
since FTP access implies that you have a properly working TCP/IP configuration.
