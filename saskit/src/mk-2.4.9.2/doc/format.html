<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>MetaKit is an efficient, small-footprint, robust, and platform-independent
database library.&nbsp; The name "MetaKit" is used as name for the file
format, as well as for the implementation (coded in C++, with interfaces
to Python and Tcl).&nbsp; MetaKit 2.0 is freely available as open source, 
with optional commercial support through my company, Equi4 Software.
<p>This document describes some of the main elements of the design of the
file format used in release 2.0 of MetaKit - which
reads all prior formats back to the 1.0 release of March 1996.
<p>For general information about MetaKit, you are kindly referred to information
on the world wide web - the MetaKit home page is at <a href="http://www.equi4.com/metakit/">http://www.equi4.com/metakit/</a>.
For the purpose of this document, here is a summary with the capabilities
of MetaKit which most affect the design of the file format.
<ul>
<li>
Data is stored in native format, reversed endian-ness is detected and dealt
with on other platforms</li>

<li>
Transaction/commit uses "Stable Storage" techniques, with automatic rollback
after catastrophic failure</li>

<li>
Data can be loaded on demand, or serialized for transport over any communication
channel</li>

<li>
Integers use "adaptive sizing" to store each value in 1..32 bits, automatically
adjusted to match the range</li>

<li>
Other formats include: 0-byte terminated strings, binary data (2 formats),
and 4/8-byte IEEE floating point</li>

<li>
Multiple relational ("flat") and hierarchically structured datasets can
be stored in a single file</li>

<li>
Datafiles are self-descriptive, generic utilities can be used to inspect
and manipulate any MetaKit datafile</li>

<li>
MetaKit supports instant on-the-fly datafile restructuring, with full commit/rollback
capability</li>
</ul>
MetaKit is being used by hundreds of developers, in products ranging from
custom-made client-server applications, software utilities, website databases,
numerical/statistical data-storage, groupware, development tools, to financial
applications such as POS and home banking.  It can be embedded into the
application, requiring no installation - or used as a shared library (DLL).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>BASIC DATA STRUCTURE</b>
<p>To describe the format used for the datafiles, it is necessary to introduce
some terminology and to describe how data is organized.&nbsp; What MetaKit
does, is present a more or less relational perspective on data storage.
<ul>
<li>
Data is stored in tabular format, called a <i><b>view</b>.</i></li>

<li>
Views consist of zero or more <b><i>rows</i></b> of information.</li>

<li>
Each row consists of one or more <b><i>properties</i></b> containing one
data item.</li>

<li>
Properties can be strings, integers, floating point, binary data, but also
<b><i>subviews</i></b>.</li>
</ul>
The first three of these are equivalent to the relational <i>table, record,
</i>and
<i>attribute</i>.&nbsp;
The fourth makes it possible to store hierarchically structured data (subviews
are an advanced feature and will not be further described here).
<p>But the fundamental concept of MetaKit, is that all data is stored <i>column-wise</i>.&nbsp;
A <i>view</i> (table) with 10,000 <i>rows</i> (records), consisting of
25 <i>properties</i> (attributes), is stored on file as a data structure
pointing to 25 <i>columns</i> of bytes.&nbsp; Each of these columns may
well have a different format - depending on their datatype, and each will
contain 10,000 entries. Each column is stored as a single <i>contiguous</i>
area on file, which can be reallocated (i.e. moved) to accommodate size
changes later on.
<p>This column-based data organization has far-reaching consequences for
the implementation.&nbsp; For one, the implementation fully hides
the column-wise structure and present a normal <i>container-like</i> row-wise
API, which matches the conceptual / relational model.&nbsp; Furthermore,
a range of techniques has been implemented to offer high performance.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>FILE FORMAT OVERVIEW</b>
<p>Once you switch your mind to this column-wise approach, the format of
MetaKit datafiles becomes quite simple to describe:
<ul>
<li>
An 8-byte header</li>

<li>
A structural definition of all views stored in this file (this is not necessarily
right after the header)</li>

<li>
For each view: a row count and a number of &lt;offset,size> pairs, each
defining a column in the file</li>

<li>
And - scattered all across the file - the actual columns of data</li>
</ul>
For a view of N rows by M columns, the row count of N plus the M column
definitions fully describe its contents - just like a row count of N with
N row definitions would in a traditional row-by-row database.
<p>Note that the amount of information needed to define all views and columns
can remain <i>very</i> small.&nbsp; The number of rows in each view affects
only the size of each column, not the number of them.&nbsp; This effect
is used while opening a datafile: MetaKit quickly reads the header, description,
and all column position/size information.&nbsp; From then on, access to
data is basically instant - with seeks doing the rest (actually, most of
it is memory-mapped file access).&nbsp; To use the previous example: a
view with 10,000 rows of 25 properties ends up being managed as 25 columns
on file - which is a very simple task.
<p>The row counts and the &lt;offset,size> tuples defining all columns
are stored in an tagged-byte format, with as many bytes as need to represent
each integer value.&nbsp; This format is space efficient for small
files, and is able to adapt to file sizes (and offsets) which are more
than 32 bits.&nbsp; All values are stored consecutively and are loaded
very quickly (this includes the more complex case when subviews are part
of the data structure).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>STRUCTURE DEFINITION</b>
<p>The description stored in each datafile is a string which precisely
describes the name of all views and subviews, and the name and type of
all properties in these subviews.&nbsp; An example of such a <i>definition
string</i> (as stored on file) will make it clear how the information is
represented:
<p><font size=-1>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; companies[name:S,offices[department:S,address:S,employees[name:S,salary:I,photo:M],phone:S],revenue:D]</font>
<p>Datatypes are currently defined as one of the following:
<blockquote><b><tt>S</tt></b> - string (null-byte terminated)
<br><b><tt>I</tt></b> - integer (1..32 bits, adapting at run time)
<br><b><tt>F</tt></b> - 32-bit floating point
<br><b><tt>D</tt></b> - 64-bit floating point
<br><b><tt>B</tt></b> - untyped binary data
<br><b><tt>M</tt></b> - "memo" binary data (see below)</blockquote>
The above example describes a datafiles with information about companies,
each having a variable number of offices, which in turn have a varying
number of employees.&nbsp; Other information can be added in the same file,
it is not limited to a single <i>view</i> (companies in this case).
<p>This string, as well as all strings stored as properties of rows, is
stored in UTF-8 format, which allow storing Unicode strings while maintaining
compatibility of datafiles across all platforms.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>STORING BINARY DATA</b>
<p>The file format described so far is useful for small to medium-sized
datasets (see the section on "performance" below), but as column sizes
grow, performance tends to suffer in a number of ways.&nbsp; To meet requests
to store larger amounts of data efficiently, "memo" properties were added
in March 1998.&nbsp; These add a single level of indirection, and allow
storing binary data as individually allocated objects in the datafile.&nbsp;
This mechanism works well when rows hold data items which are each of up
to 1 Mb or so.&nbsp; The current limitation is that each such <i>memo-item</i>
is loaded and saved in one step.&nbsp; A future release will allow partial
reading and writing of such items, and will in fact allow very efficient insertion
and deletion at any position within such items.&nbsp; This will allow
access, and storage of concurrent independently emitted data streams (it's
mostly a matter of designing a proper API to get at the functionality -
which is already present).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>FILE FORMAT DETAILS</b>
<p>With all this conceptual information out of the way, it is now possible
to describe the file format is somewhat more detail.
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Header</b></dt>

<dd>
The 8-byte header contains: a 2-byte magic number, which is also used to
detect endian-ness, 2 bytes reserved for future use, and a 4-byte file
offset pointing to the structural information.</dd>

<p><dt><b>Structural information</b>
<dd>
The offset in the header points to a block of data consisting of:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
a <i>format code</i>, which is adjusted when file format revisions are
made</li>

<li>
the <i>structure definition string</i>, as described above</li>

<li>
all <i>row counts</i>, and <i>&lt;offset,size></i> pairs, concatenated</li>
</ul>

<dd>
The counts, offsets, and sizes are all stored using a varying number of
bytes, most significant bits first: each byte contains a "final" bit (bit
7), which is set only on the last byte, and 7 "payload" bits from the value
itself (bits 0..6).  This format is compact and platform-neutral.</dd>

<p><dt><b>Columns</b>
<dd>
Data columns contain all items of the corresponding property, concatenated
into a single byte vector.&nbsp; The format and size of these columns is
determined by their datatype:</dd>

<ul>
<li>
Strings are concatenated, with the terminating zero bytes separating each
item.</li>

<li>
Adaptive integers - using 1..32 bits per value, depending on the largest
absolute value.</li>

<li>
Floats use 4 bytes per entry, doubles use 8 bytes per entry.</li>

<li>
Binary properties are stored using two columns (the data, plus adaptive ints for
item sizes).</li>

<li>
Memo properties also use two columns (file offsets and
item sizes - both are adaptive ints).</li>
</ul>

<dd>
Each column contains items of a single type, and can be considered as highly
optimized linear arrays of data.</dd>
</dl>
<i>Note: the 4-byte file offset in the header will be turned into a more
general "extended header" in the next file format version to drop the current
32-bit file size restriction.&nbsp; A number of changes are planned for the
way structural information is stored, to make it possible to open
datafiles more lazily and perform efficient partial commits.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>FREE SPACE MANAGEMENT AND RECOVERY</b>
<p>The datafile format of MetaKit contains no other information than what
has been described so far.&nbsp; Specifically, there is no "free space"
pool.&nbsp; This is possible, because free space can be deduced from what
is present in the file - it consists of those areas of the file which are
not occupied by the information described so far (header, structure def,
column defs, columns).
<p>This lack of redundancy improves robustness (the potential for inconsistencies
is reduced), is more efficient (less information to carry around), and
reduces file size.
<p>Recovery is based on "stable storage" - a very effective technique which
makes the datafile resilient against catastrophic failure.&nbsp; It all
works by never writing changes to a datafile <i>over</i> current data.&nbsp;
All changes are allocated and written to currently unused areas of the
file (extending it if necessary).&nbsp; Only changed data is rewritten.&nbsp;
On commit, all changes are flushed,
and when this has been completed, a single offset in the file header is
overwritten (this is atomic) - pointing to the new state.&nbsp;
Once the commit is complete, free space in the file is redefined to include
old and now obsolete areas of the file, and to exclude the newly allocated
data.
<p>To date, with thousands of users known to be using software based on
MetaKit in production-grade commercial products, no case has ever been
reported of a corrupted data file.&nbsp; MetaKit does not contain any recovery/repair
code - there is no need.
<p>The trade-off is that datafiles which get modified can grow to roughly
twice their optimum size.&nbsp; Despite this, MetaKit datafile sizes are
often <i>smaller</i> than with other approaches.&nbsp; The
reasons for this are that MetaKit supports variable-sized data with no
overhead, that integers tend to be packed very densely, that there is <i>no</i>
overhead per row, and that techniques such as B-trees with partially-filled
nodes are not used.
<p>It goes without saying that all unused data areas get re-used when possible
- file size usually increases during the first few commits, and remains more or less
stable after that.&nbsp; For those cases where slack is unacceptable, a
simple full re-save can be used to produce a fresh, optimally-packed datafile.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>ON-THE-FLY RESTRUCTURING</b>
<p>The column-wise datafile format makes it possible to restructure datafiles
- i.e. add or delete properties - very efficiently.&nbsp; All it takes,
is reading the structural data (which happens during open anyway), creating
or deleting one or more columns, and storing the adjusted structural data.&nbsp;
Since no rows are accessed at all, this is virtually instant.
<p>This capability has recently been used to implement a <i>generic database
server - </i>it starts out empty, with no idea what data it will store,
and it adapts whenever clients connect.&nbsp; Although this is in itself
an interesting technical feature, the value lies in <i>long-lived data</i>,
since it is now possible to store information in whatever format seems
appropriate right now, and to write software which evolves to work with
more complex structures overtime.&nbsp; Whenever a datafile is opened,
its format can be inspected, applying the transformations which are required
to bring it up to date - instantly, during open.&nbsp; Even if the data
is read-only, such on-the-fly adaptations can be used for the duration
of the run (simply by never committing).
<p>The restructuring capabiltity, and the fact that it can be done almost
instantly, is very useful for <i>long-lived data</i>. It
simplifies the task of writing software which can handle all file formats used
in previous releases (backward compatibility).
Adding or dropping information as new releases of
a product are issued no longer leads to compatibility problems or lengthy
conversions.  Furthermore, techniques are being developed to let <i>older</i>
software deal with files created by <i>newer</i> releases (forward compatibility).
This solves 
a common problem in today's software, which forces users to continuously
upgrade their software to be able to easily exchange files with others.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>PERFORMANCE</b>
<p>The performance of this data format is <i>extremely </i>difficult to
assess.&nbsp; During the evolution from version 1.0 to the current 2.0
release, improvements have been made of some two orders of magnitude.&nbsp;
This is probably not very informative, since it might simply reflect how
bad the original design was.
<p>But there are several factors which can help illustrate why this is
probably not the case:
<ul>
<li>
Performance matters only in those parts of the code which are frequently
executed: <i>i.e. inside loops</i>.</li>

<li>
Locality of reference can have a dramatic impact on performance with today's
CPU caches.</li>

<li>
Minimizing I/O requests has become meaningless, when memory-mapped files
and paging is used.</li>

<li>
Many repetitive loops over data tend to process a large number or rows,
but to access only a few columns.</li>
</ul>
It turns out that MetaKit performance varies widely, depending on the design
and use of the data structures.&nbsp; Note that there are virtually no
<i>database
indexes. </i>This is not a lack of functionality, but a deliberate design
choice.&nbsp; Experience shows that MetaKit frequently outperforms other
approaches by mere brute-force.&nbsp; A recent test on a modern Pentium
II / 400 MHz CPU, shows that search speeds exceed 500,000 string scans
per second and 1,000,000 integer scans per second.&nbsp; There is a definite
trade-off between indexing (with techniques such as B-trees and extensible
hashing) and the overhead it imposes for updates - and mere scanning.
<p>Evidently, at some point, it will be better to index by key values than
to scan millions of strings for a match.&nbsp; This is where subviews in
MetaKit come in handy.&nbsp; By structuring data in a "slightly hierarchical"
manner, searches again often end up being over just thousands or tens of
thousands of entries.&nbsp; Also, keeping data sorted (in some sense) and then
doing binary search can often be an effective option (this is part of the Metakit
API).
<p>Sequential searching is well suited for keyword searches and for <i>regex</i>
pattern-matching, and by its very nature well suited for <i>ad-hoc</i>
queries: all properties are searchable without the need to decide what
key indexes to define up front.
<p>Some further explanations why performance is high in MetaKit:
<ul>
<li>
No indexes means smaller datafiles, this increases memory residence and
reduces random seeks</li>

<li>
Inner loops over a single column are very effective: data is contiguous
on file and caching works optimally</li>

<li>
The code is simple, and therefore small - it is more likely to fit in the
CPU cache in its entirety</li>

<li>
Row <i>width</i> does not affect search/access performance, nor does the
number or size of extra properties.</li>
</ul>
In conclusion: compact data representations work increasingly well with
today's fast CPU's and large RAM sizes. By turning a dataset which is 100
Mb with traditional means, into a few columns requiring 20 Mb, databases
not only end up being completely memory-resident, the column-wise structure
for each property also makes CPU caches perform at their very best.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>LIMITATIONS</b>
<p>There are some limitations in the current MetaKit implementation,
these are currently being addressed:
<ul>
<li>
When column sizes grow, update performance suffers (the simplest solution
is to introduce some subviews)</li>

<li>
Concurrent file updates are currently impossible due to cache coherence
issues (solution: client/server or diff's)</li>

<li>
Data items straddling a 4 Kb page boundary get read in, instead of taking
advantage of memory-mapped files</li>
</ul>
There are also some issues which affect the file format design (to be addressed
in the next file format revision):
<ul>
<li>
Open/commit performance is proportional to structural complexity (need
a way to do partial opens/commits)</li>

<li>
There should be a way to adjust alignment of data stored on file, so memory-mapped
files work better</li>
<li>
Additional safeguards are sometimes needed to detect currupted datafiles
(such as file-transfer errors).
</ul>
Work is currently under way to address each of these issues.&nbsp; This
will allow the efficient use of MetaKit datafiles when they are in the Gb
range.&nbsp; The changes will be made in such a way that backward compatibility
can be maintained (i.e. new releases will retain the ability to read 2.0
format datafiles, and will transparently perform adjustments when writing
to them).
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>In the end, <i>the proof is in the pudding</i>.&nbsp; As it turns out,
three years of MetaKit use and evolution have shown that a lot of performance
can be achieved as a result of reducing file format and implementation
complexity.&nbsp; Robustness is achieved through minimizing redundancy,
while fail-safety is achieved through a form of controlled duplication.
<p>Both of these have led to a format which is very simple, flexible enough
to evolve (half of the datatypes were added after the fact), and which
has the capability of being instantly restructured to adapt to new data
structures.&nbsp; This latter property of the MetaKit datafile format is
what makes it <i>future-proof</i> for application developers - in a very
practical sense.
<p>There are some drawbacks to using column-wise storage, but the current
implementation shows that despite this, a number of technical "tricks"
can lead to an implementation (consisting of 16,000 lines of C++) which
shows excellent performance in databases scaling to 10,000
views/subviews <i>or</i> 100,000 rows.&nbsp; Future versions will aim to make
10,000 views/subviews <i>times</i> 100,000 rows efficient.
