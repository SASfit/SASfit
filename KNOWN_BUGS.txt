A list of known bugs:
(Not exclusive and caused by >15 years evolutionary code structure. An attempt to fix
them without rewrite requires unreasonably large amounts of time and energy.
Instead, a rewrite/redesign is the way to go in the near future.)

- moments of analytical size distribution do not work for multi-fit
  (shows incorrect/bogus values)
- parameter ranges for fitting do not work for multi-fit
- If SASfit is started from a directory with non-ascii characters (e.g. Ã©) it
  will not run and give a 'file open failed' error. 
  This is confirmed and tested on Windows XP&7.
