revision 1.29	
  Documentation update
revision 1.28
  Continuing with the examples suggested by Alain Zuur, added
  LineTo, MoveTo, PolylineTo, and simplified bezier functions.
  Also updated the version to 0.5.0.2
revision 1.27
  Updated documentation
revision 1.26
  Added WmfRead function, suggested by Alain of Highland Statistics
revision 1.25
  Updated comments for release
  Tested under 8.0.3 and 8.0.5 for compatibility. This limited UNICODE support.
revision 1.24
  Preparation for release. Added comments.
  New approach for problem with locking enhanced metafiles from office
  products.
revision 1.23
  Modified text scaling somewhat--still needs work on EMR parameters
  (e.g., EMREXTTEXTOUT and EMRCREATEFONTINDIRECT) to make the metafiles
  able to recreate themselves on a canvas.
revision 1.22
  Added a logging to file function for debugging
  Limited the number of parameters that are considered -- GDICOMMENT and
  STRETCHDIBITS come up with over 8000 parameters each!
revision 1.21
  Fixed a few typos and managed the clipboard type reporting better
revision 1.20
  Broke out the different types of clipboard formats, added comments
revision 1.19
  Minor corrections in ensuring elements are appended properly
revision 1.18
  Added first wmf paste implementation
revision 1.17
  Added textual and DIB support
  DIB support doesn't work right yet. All calls to GetDIBits are failing
  in nonunderstandable ways.
revision 1.16
  Added wmf paste command
revision 1.15
  Updated Unicode portions for versions of Tcl earlier than 8.1.1
revision 1.14
  Updated version string
revision 1.13
  Separated complete verbose information from the canvas output.
  The canvas output could be derived from the verbose output in a tcl script,
  but seemed more convenient to add it as an info option.
revision 1.12
  Updated wmf info -verbose output to filter out irrelevant information
revision 1.11
  Return to non-empty version
revision 1.10
  New version created from code update
revision 1.9
  Moved free of buffer until after its use.
revision 1.8
  Updated comments on copy, and made "both" the default
revision 1.7
  Added option to produce old-style metafile on the clipboard
  Cleaned up the clipboard logic
revision 1.6
  Added ability to use hdc context names for wmf reference hdcs
  Fixed bug where reference hdc was released if created externally to wmf
revision 1.5
  Added info function
  Cleaned up residual warnings. I wish Tcl_SetResult would change its
  prototype!
revision 1.4
  Removed memory cleanup in "detach" logic since the HDC extension
  will often be unloaded before WMF.
revision 1.3
  Added ability to use HDC context addresses as well as names.
  Allowed extension to work with or without hdc extension
revision 1.2
  Added mechanism to set hdc functions after loading extension.
  Changed default filename extension to .emf rather than .wmf
  Support copying an existing HDC instead of always using the default.
  Added the complete skeleton for the DllEntryPoint
revision 1.1
  Initial revision
