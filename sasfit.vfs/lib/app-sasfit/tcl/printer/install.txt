Version 0.7.0.3

Just unpack the archive (for pkunzip, use the -d option) to your
favorite place to put extensions. This should usually be under your TCL
directory's LIB. In Tcl 8.0 and newer, this directory will be
automatically searched; for earlier versions you will want to add this
directory to your TCLLIBDIR environment variable, or to your auto_path.

If you have put these extensions in the same directory as other 
extensions, remember to rerun 
	pkg_mkIndex . *.dll

If you have put them in a directory by themselves, the supplied
pkgIndex.tcl file will suffice.

It responds to the load command:
  load printer.dll

It also responds to the package indexing commands.

If you are using packages (strongly recommended), you do not need to use
the load command. Simply include
   package require printer
in a wish script, and the printer extension will be automatically loaded.

This package was built using Microsoft VC++ 6.0 and Borland C++ version 4.53. 
It will (possibly) not work  with other compilers. The makefile
provided is also for  use with the same compiler used to build that DLL. 
It will assuredly require modifications for any  other compiler, and 
possibly for your development environment.

That's why source code is provided.
