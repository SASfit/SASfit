  Recovery from disk failure
revision 1.61	
  Removed all warnings from standard compilation under Tcl 8.4.7
  Rewrote printer send functionality to use WritePrinter
  Relies on DEVNAMES wDeviceOffset for printer name rather than DEVMODE.
    This prevents truncation of printer names longer than 32 characters.
    Added a printername member to the context structure
  Removed a few unneeded parameters, clarified a few snippets of code
revision 1.60
  More error checking, especially that due to Steve Bold (stevebold@hotmail.com)
  providing his changes to prevent long printer names from overwhelming the
  printer structure, and avoiding a free memory error when there
  is no default printer.
revision 1.59
  Updated version number for incremental release
revision 1.58
  Postscript check and change suggested by Doug Jackson, douglas.h.jackson@intel.com
  Fix to attribute update for paper size provided by Jon Hilbert
revision 1.57
  Removed unnecessary initialization which may cause the toplevel to lose focus.
  Made flags more consistent.
revision 1.56
  Cleaned up matching on exact printer names per jhilbert's bug report
  Cleaned up error reporting and caught some new error conditions
  Prepared for release, with much thanks to  jhilbert <jhilbert@hilbertsoft.com>
  for this set of fixes.
revision 1.55
  Updated version number for release
revision 1.54
  Added some additional checks by Jon Hilbert
  Also added paper handling and changing code by Jon Hilbert
revision 1.53
  Performed a check before doing a page setup dialog for the default
  printer. This dialog was bringing up an error message if there was
  no default printer.
  This fix was suggested by : "Charles E. Matthews" <cmatt@attglobal.net>
revision 1.52
  Moved log external to source
revision 1.51
  Fixed size of fn array. Thanks to Charles Matthews for the report!
revision 1.50
  Updated version number for release
revision 1.49
  Added logic to get the state of the All/Selection/Page numbers radio button
  and report it in the "pring flag" attribute
revision 1.48
  Checking for some newer printers with !No passthroughs.
  Also, ensuring favorites are used in all enum printers
revision 1.47
  Added correction for metric locales in the page setup dialog, as provided
  by Michael Thomsen <miksen@ideogramic.com>
revision 1.46
  Reporting both PRINTDLG and DEVMODE copies--the one from
  DEVMODE represents how many will be output, while the one
  from PRINTDLG represents how many the printing _program_ is
  expected to spool
revision 1.45
  Added "minimum page" and "maximum page" watches to set the bounds for the
  page selection.
revision 1.44
  Fixed reported error by Markus Meng <meng.engineering@bluewin.ch>:
  copies was reported from the PRINTDLG structure, when it should be
reported from the DEVMODE structure. The difference is apparent on
  printers that handle multiple (non-collated) copies on their own.
  Also, ceased to report first page/last page if these are not set.
revision 1.43
  Ensured port, driver, printer name initialized (Jim Garrison, <garrison@qualcomm.com>)
  Used UTF translations for printer name and location (Andrei Sobchuck <andreis@itware.com.ua>
  Updated version to 0.9.6.4
revision 1.42
  Updated version to 0.9.6.3
  Corrected error reported by Mads Linden <mads@electronicfarm.com>, noting
  that a printer opened with "printer open" does not set the defaults in
  the "printer dialog select". That now occurs.
revision 1.41
  Documentation cleanup
revision 1.40
  Removed warnings before release
revision 1.39
  Update version to 0.9.6.2
  Added 'printer option' command and the "autoclose" concept
  Fixed the papersize calculation to account for default metric drivers
  Added comment blocks above most interesting functions
  Carried the allocation of printer_values structures to completion
  including cases where the ClientData argument must be reset.
  Added the beginnings of print cancellation dialog support.
revision 1.38
  Removed unused code sections
revision 1.37
  Removed unused functions
revision 1.36
  Added capability to open several printers, and manage them all
  Made page_setup and printer open -name work, along with attribute changes
  for open printers.
revision 1.35
  Changed DEVMODE structure in printer_values to be allocated.
  This seems to have cleared up a problem with losing esoteric settings.
revision 1.34
  Used ReplaceDC to complete effect of PageSetupDlg
  Began adding specific hDC hooks for all relevant calls
  Differentiated safe and unsafe printer initialization
  Track individual managed hdcs so that all can be closed, irrespective
  of presence of HDC extension, or order of extension unloading
  Moved more complex functionality to functions
  Drove main print command from a table instead of a switch
  Changed version number to 0.9.6.1
  Added 'verbose' option to printer list usage message
  More properly supported both postscript and nonpostscript printers
  with the POSTSCRIPT_PASSTHROUGH escape
  Added parameters to a few calls to better capture the whole manipulation
revision 1.33
  To avoid order dependencies on order of unloading, which can cause
  problems when exiting under Windows 95 and Windows 98,
  a separate container of HDCs is built and maintained.
  When the printer extension is unloaded, only this container is
  consulted.
revision 1.32
  Added use of HDC package
  Better synchronized devmode structures
revision 1.31
  Added ability to delete printer attributes
  Added a few more error checks and fixed some error messages
revision 1.30
  Added support for named contexts, rather than just numbered ones.
  Also, added a parameter to support postscript printing better.
  Checked for appropriate contexts in centralized DC routine.
  Continued support for context addresses
  This should now work seamlessly with gdi and wmf
  Uses the HDC extension
revision 1.29
  Changed to invoke the EPSPRINTING escape only when postscript printing is desired.
revision 1.28
  Added stubs support
revision 1.27
  Removed the code to override printer selection with defaults.
  Now this is only used for the default printer selection, since
  otherwise user-selected options in properties are overridden!
revision 1.26
  Added code to get default values from printer before used.
  Called this function whenever printer has changed.
  Also, added a function to delete attributes.
  Bumped version to 0.9.3.2
revision 1.25
  Changed processing for DEVNAMES; previous implementation was incorrect.
  Tested thoroughly with Tcl release 8.1, NT 4.0 SP 5.
  Updated command descriptions.
revision 1.24
  Updated to handle additional error conditions
revision 1.23
  Added ability to get and set attributes in the printer attr command.
  These include arbitrary attributes of the user's selection.
  Currently no way to UNSET the attributes.
revision 1.22
  Added a test so if DM_PAPERSIZE is selected, the size is changed for landscape when necessary. Windows does not check this.
revision 1.21
  Moved all attributes to a Tcl hash table, and reorganized the code so
  it would be easy to add sets and gets for individual attributes.
revision 1.20
  Added DEVMODE, DEVNAMES to printer_values structure, and updated them
  with all printer open/printer dialog select/printer close calls.
  Added the hash table to the printer_values structure, but no use is made
  of this yet.
  Tested on Win98, Win95, and WinNT with good results.
revision 1.19
  Added guards around GlobalLock, which can fail under Win95 oddly.
revision 1.18
  Removed remainder of version-dependent code and replaced with runtime
  check for windows version
revision 1.17
  Removed all dependencies on WIN32S #define. Instead, use a runtime
  check. This way, only one version of the extension need exist.
  Also, fixed enumprinter to be useful under win95.
  Also, added network printers for win95 and winnt.
  Fixed a memory leak in printer list
revision 1.16
  Added notifier loop calls to allow Tcl/Tk to repaint and do other idle tasks while the dialog is up.
revision 1.15
  Added fixes for ISO standard paper size conversion per bug report
  by Andreas Sievers <Andreas.Sievers@t-mobil.de>.
  Changed call to get parent HWND in hopes of getting the proper window
  to cause refresh when a standard dialog is up (it didn't work). Still
  need to find the right wrapper window.
  Added handling for -name argument to printer job.
revision 1.14
  *** empty log message ***
revision 1.13
  Cleaned up the open routine and the send routine to handle
  coordination of the page setup dialog and the select dialog
revision 1.12
  Added a character-width routine to aid in text output
revision 1.11
  Add -hDC flag to printer send
  Add "job" logic so a job can be started when needed

  dialogs, and made code acceptable for 4.1, 4.2, and 8.0 Tcl.
revision 1.9
  Cleaned up global resources better
  Allowed flags in printer selection dialog
  Added more attributes to printer attr--it will need the match soon!
revision 1.8
  Recovery from disk failure
