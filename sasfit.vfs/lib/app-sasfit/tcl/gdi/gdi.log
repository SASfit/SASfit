  	michael: 1.62
  Recovery from disk failure
revision 1.62	
  Added -unicode option to support Unicode print output.
revision 1.61
  Eliminated warnings under Tcl 8.4.7 (may have added them in other versions)
revision 1.60
  Removed unused variable
revision 1.59
  Added first implementation of dash option
revision 1.58
  Jasper Taylor <jasper.taylor@ed.ac.uk> provided reasonable implementation
  of the smooth options.
revision 1.57
  Updated version for release
  Made arc angle adjust properly for eccentricity of the bounding ellipse
  to match canvas semantics
revision 1.56
  Removed two compilation warnings by adding a cast
  Changed the Arc code to support drawing the arcs in the correct direction
  under Win95, WinNT, and Win2k.
  Thanks to Nigel Dodd <nigel.dodd@avellino.com>
revision 1.55
  Moved log to an auxiliiary file
revision 1.54
  Updated version for release
  Thanks to Charles E. Matthews for reporting the bounds array problem
revision 1.53
  Added a semblance of a "smoothing" function for lines
  Fixed the array bounds in hdc.
revision 1.52
  Moved GetLastError to prevent error being masked.
revision 1.51
  Updated documentation
revision 1.50
  Added option to text command to fill the text with the background
  color (-backfill).
  Added configure command to allow setting of the background color.
  Currently the background color is used ONLY by the text command
  (i.e., the background of the printable rectangle is not affected.
  The reason for the limitation is to avoid having to hold GDI
  commands until closeout time or rerunning the metafile).
revision 1.49
  Modified the Rectangle and Ellipse calls to make behavior match the canvas
  a little better. Thanks to Michael Thomsen at Ideogramic for the report
  of these anomalise.
revision 1.48
  Fixed parsing of logical and physical extents, and tested for these properly
  in the argument parser.
revision 1.47
  Remove two more warnings
revision 1.46
  Fixed default return value from GdiWordToWeight
revision 1.45
  Eliminate warnings before release
revision 1.44
  Added more font modifier parsing logic, as suggested by Michael Thomsen,
  <miksen@ideogramic.com>.
revision 1.43
  Removed compiler warnings
  Changed use of formatting flags in text formatting
  Changed 2D shape fills to default to no fill
  Added -single flag to text -- not sure if this is useful, yet.
  Some working items in place for inclusion of "macro" routines
  for canvas and text printing.
revision 1.42
  Changed STRETCHBLT to STRETCHDIB to reflect actual usage
revision 1.41
  Added gdi photo command as initially contributed by Lukas Rosenthaler <lukas.rosenthaler@balcab.ch>
  Added casts for numerical type changes to reduce warnings.
revision 1.40
  Removed use of Windows-specific platform declarations
revision 1.39
  For Tcl 8.1 and newer, added Utf to External conversion so character
rendering will work properly.
revision 1.38
  Updated version number for release.
  Allowed both numeric and named contexts.
  Enabled extension to work with or without HDC extension.
revision 1.37
  Updated error message for release
revision 1.36
  Added hdc package, with the result that graphics contexts can be
  named rather than just being a number.
  Also added the GetObjectType check to ensure that DCs are appropriate
  for the operation.
  Both the wmf and printer extensions can provide contexts for this
  package.
revision 1.35
  Added -calc switch to copybits to return sizes without actually printing.
  Fixed a bug with the -scale switch in copybits, as reported and
  corrected by Pascal Bouvier
revision 1.34
  Added support for gdi line command -arrow and -arrowshape
  Updated minor version in preparation for release.
revision 1.33
  Added stubs support
revision 1.32
  Update GdiArc code to draw in proper Y direction.
  Bug reported by Tony Strachan, a.j.strachan@swansea.ac.uk
revision 1.31
  Changed atoi() calls to atol() for arguments representing coordinates
  on the drawables.
revision 1.30
  Updated ISOMETRIC mode to work properly
revision 1.29
  Align all mapping modes to proper scaling for pixels and points.
  This should make the font mechanism work a lot like that of Tk
  (without requiring Tk).
revision 1.28
  Moved test in copybits to after context is set.
revision 1.27
  Added missing semicolon
revision 1.26
  Add code to recover from a failure of the GetCharWidth32 function,
  which has been reported by Andreas Sievers <Andreas.Sievers@t-mobil.de>
  to occur under Windows 95
revision 1.25
  Added better reporting for changes in the mapping mode.
revision 1.24
  Removed deprecated functions
  Modified description and comments in preparation for release
revision 1.23
  Consolidated comments, headers, and usage into the file
revision 1.22
  Moved in special handling for top-level windows (to get frame) and
  added return value from copybits to reflect size at destination.
revision 1.21
  Changed assignments to remove all code warnings.
revision 1.20
  Added comments to improve readability.
  Changed some local variables to float to support better scanning
  of user input.
revision 1.19
  First attempt to incorporate work suggested by Arndt Roger Scheider
  (roger@prs.de) and Heiko Schock (heiko@prs.de).
  Added command "copybits" to go via DIBitmaps from the screen to the printer.
  This should be more general a solution that the previous BitBlt.
  Also, added long-awaited options to the command to copy a particular
  window in the Tk heirarchy (instead of just the main application window),
  to take just a part of a window, and to place the bits at a desired location
  in the destination window.
revision 1.18
  *** empty log message ***
revision 1.17
  Added mapping mode command to allow transformations of the coordinate
  space for printing.
  Landscape and portrait mode are a characteristic of the printer driver,
  and thus can't be set through this interface (at least under Windows).
revision 1.16
  Fixed a typo for a usage message
revision 1.15
  Added character width function
revision 1.14
  Updated to handle system colors properly
revision 1.13
  Changed algorithm for # colors to handle "short" cases better.
revision 1.12
  Added brushes to the commands that take them.
  These are limited brushes--just solid colors
revision 1.11
  Added color to text items
revision 1.10
  Added line color handling for all geometric shapes
revision 1.9
  Added initial color information
revision 1.8
  Added Pen to allow width setting (no color or style yet)
revision 1.7
  Updated documentation, added fallback for older versions of Tcl
  However, earlier versions do not make it easy to get the HWND;
  it will need to be emulated or copied from Tcl8
revision 1.6
  Updated to include new "canvas-like" functionality, but without yet
removing the old "postscript operator-like" functionality.
  Implemented GdiArc command except for fills, stipples, and colors.
  Did not yet reuse canvas code, which is heavy on the storage maintenance
  and interaction (e.g., tags) functionality.
revision 1.5
  Removed test code
revision 1.4
  Recovery from disk failure
