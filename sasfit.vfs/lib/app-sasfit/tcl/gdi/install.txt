Version 0.9.5.1

NOTE: VERSIONS OF TCL PRIOR TO 8.0.3 REQUIRE CW3220.DLL 
TO BE IN YOUR WINDOWS SYSTEM DIRECTORY. CW3220.DLL IS A FREELY 
DISTRIBUTABLE VERSION OF THE BORLAND RUNTIME LIBRARY.
 
NOTE: VERSION 8.0.3 AND ALL FUTURE VERSIONS OF THIS EXTENSION ARE BUILT 
WITH Microsoft VISUAL C++, AND DO NOT REQUIRE CW3220.DLL.

EITHER COMPILER WILL CONTINUE TO BE CAPABLE OF BUILDING THE EXTENSION
SO LONG AS THIS IS VIABLE.

Just unpack the archive (for pkunzip, use the -d option) to your
favorite place to put extensions. This should usually be under your TCL
directory's LIB. In Tcl 8.0 and newer, this directory will be
automatically searched.

If you have put this extension in the same directory as other 
extensions, remember to rerun 
	pkg_mkIndex . *.dll
from inside of Tclsh or Wish.

If you have put these files in a directory by themselves, the supplied
pkgindex.tcl file will suffice.

It responds to the load command:
  load gdi.dll

It also responds to the package indexing commands.

If you are using packages (strongly recommended), you do not need to use
the load command. Simply include
   package require gdi
in a wish script, and the GDI extension will be automatically loaded.

This package does its thing as best I (and the contributing authors) 
know how. This does not mean it necessarily meets your need, or is 
robust enough for your application.

That's why source code is provided.
