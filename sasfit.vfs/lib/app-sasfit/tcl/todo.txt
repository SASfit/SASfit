---	error estimate of structural parameters

---	remainding the option of the graphs during recalculation of the curves
	or after loading a new data set

		opening the first time the menu leaves the prefactor and global parameter entries empty
		selecting a parameter to be fitted causes always an error message
		generating new global parameter does not work
		selecting a global parameter P1, etc does not work.
