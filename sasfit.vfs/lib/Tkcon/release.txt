WHAT:   Enhanced Tk Console for all Tk platforms

WHERE:  http://tkcon.sourceforge.net/
	http://www.purl.org/net/hobbs/tcl/script/

REQUIREMENTS: Tcl/Tk 8.0+
	Tested through Tcl/Tk 8.5.
        tkcon is all Tcl/Tk code, no compiling required

tkcon is a replacement for the standard console that comes with Tk (on
Windows/Mac, but also works on Unix).  tkcon provides many more features
than the standard console and works on all platforms where Tcl/Tk is
available.  It is meant primarily to aid one when working with the little
details inside tcl and tk and to give Unix users the GUI console provided
by default in the Mac and Windows Tk.

FEATURES:
    Command history
    Path (Unix style) / Proc / Variable name expansion
    Multiple and tabbed consoles, each with its own state (via multiple
        interpreters)
    Captures stdout and stderr to console window (puts overridden)
    Hot errors (click on error result to see stack trace)
    Electric character matching (a la emacs)
    Electric proc highlighting
    Enhanced history searching
    Configurable
    Cut / Copy / Paste between windows (interoperates with native platform)
    Communication between consoles and other Tk interpreters
        (including non-tcl ones)
    Works on all Tk platforms

Notable updates since v2.3:

* Added tabbed console feature
* Do not add history duplicates
* Improved ability to use tkcon as a package and/or wrapped console
* Add options to override exit command and control [X] close behavior
* Set $_ to last command result
* Stop use of menu tearoffs
* Enable more send variants
* Improve "Interp -> Packages" menu handling when many packages are present
