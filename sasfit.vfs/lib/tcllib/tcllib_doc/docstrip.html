<h2><a name="description">DESCRIPTION</a></h2>
<p>

<strong>Docstrip</strong> is a tool created to support a brand of Literate
Programming. It is most common in the (La)TeX community, where it
is being used for pretty much everything from the LaTeX core and up,
but there is nothing about <strong>docstrip</strong> which prevents using it
for other types of software.
<p>

In short, the basic principle of literate programming is that program
source should primarily be written and structured to suit the
developers (and advanced users who want to peek &quot;under the hood&quot;), not
to suit the whims of a compiler or corresponding source code consumer.
This means literate sources often need some kind of &quot;translation&quot; to an
illiterate form that dumb software can understand.
The <strong>docstrip</strong> Tcl package handles this translation.
<p>

Even for those who do not whole-hartedly subscribe to the philosophy
behind literate programming, <strong>docstrip</strong> can bring greater
clarity to in particular:
<ul>
  <li> programs employing non-obvious mathematics
  <br><br>
<li> projects where separate pieces of code, perhaps in
    different languages, need to be closely coordinated.
</ul>
The first is by providing access to much more powerful typographical
features for source code comments than are possible in plain text.
The second is because all the separate pieces of code can be kept
next to each other in the same source file.
<p>

The way it works is that the programmer edits directly only one or
several &quot;master&quot; source code files, from which <strong>docstrip</strong>
generates the more traditional &quot;source&quot; files compilers or the like
would expect. The master sources typically contain a large amount of
documentation of the code, sometimes even in places where the code
consumers would not allow any comments. The etymology of &quot;docstrip&quot;
is that this <em>doc</em>umentation was <em>strip</em>ped away (although
&quot;code extraction&quot; might be a better description, as it has always
been a matter of copying selected pieces of the master source rather
than deleting text from it).
The <strong>docstrip</strong> Tcl package contains a reimplementation of
the basic extraction functionality from the <strong>docstrip</strong>
program, and thus makes it possible for a Tcl interpreter to read
and interpret the master source files directly.
<p>

<h2><a name="file_format">File format</a></h2>
<p>

The basic unit <strong>docstrip</strong> operates on are the <em>lines</em> of
a master source file. Extraction consists of selecting some of these
lines to be copied from input text to output text. The basic
distinction is that between <em>code lines</em> (which are copied and
do not begin with a percent character) and <em>comment lines</em>
(which begin with a percent character and are not copied).

<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
   docstrip::extract [join {
     {% comment}
     {% more comment !&quot;#$%&amp;/(}
     {some command}
     { % blah $blah &quot;Not a comment.&quot;}
     {% abc; this is comment}
     {# def; this is code}
     {ghi}
     {% jkl}
   } \n] {}
</pre></td></tr></table></p>
returns the same sequence of lines as
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
   join {
     {some command}
     { % blah $blah &quot;Not a comment.&quot;}
     {# def; this is code}
     {ghi} &quot;&quot;
   } \n
</pre></td></tr></table></p>

It does not matter to <strong>docstrip</strong> what format is used for the
documentation in the comment lines, but in order to do better than
plain text comments, one typically uses some markup language. Most
commonly LaTeX is used, as that is a very established standard and
also provides the best support for mathematical formulae, but the
<strong>docstrip::util</strong> package also gives some support for
<em>doctools</em>-like markup.
<p>

Besides the basic code and comment lines, there are also
<em>guard lines</em>, which begin with the two characters '%&lt;', and
<em>meta-comment lines</em>, which begin with the two characters
'%%'. Within guard lines there is furthermore the distinction between
<em>verbatim guard lines</em>, which begin with '%&lt;&lt;', and ordinary
guard lines, where the '%&lt;' is not followed by another '&lt;'. The last
category is by far the most common.
<p>

Ordinary guard lines conditions extraction of the code line(s) they
guard by the value of a boolean expression; the guarded block of
code lines will only be included if the expression evaluates to true.
The syntax of an ordinary guard line is one of
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
    '%' '&lt;' STARSLASH EXPRESSION '&gt;'
    '%' '&lt;' PLUSMINUS EXPRESSION '&gt;' CODE
</pre></td></tr></table></p>
where
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
    STARSLASH  ::=  '*' | '/'
    PLUSMINUS  ::=  '+' | '-' |
    EXPRESSION ::= SECONDARY | SECONDARY ',' EXPRESSION
                 | SECONDARY '|' EXPRESSION
    SECONDARY  ::= PRIMARY | PRIMARY '&amp;' SECONDARY
    PRIMARY    ::= TERMINAL | '!' PRIMARY | '(' EXPRESSION ')'
    CODE       ::= { any character except end-of-line }
</pre></td></tr></table></p>
Comma and vertical bar both denote 'or'. Ampersand denotes 'and'.
Exclamation mark denotes 'not'. A TERMINAL can be any nonempty string
of characters not containing '&gt;', '&amp;', '|', comma, '(', or ')',
although the <strong>docstrip</strong> manual is a bit restrictive and only
guarantees proper operation for strings of letters (although even
the LaTeX core sources make heavy use also of digits in TERMINALs).
The second argument of <b class='cmd'>docstrip::extract</b> is the list of those
TERMINALs that should count as having the value 'true'; all other
TERMINALs count as being 'false' when guard expressions are evaluated.
<p>

In the case of a '%&lt;*<em>EXPRESSION</em>&gt;' guard, the lines guarded are
all lines up to the next '%&lt;/<em>EXPRESSION</em>&gt;' guard with the same
<em>EXPRESSION</em> (compared as strings). The blocks of code delimited
by such '*' and '/' guard lines must be properly nested.
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
   set text [join {
      {begin}
      {%&lt;*foo&gt;}
      {1}
      {%&lt;*bar&gt;}
      {2}
      {%&lt;/bar&gt;}
      {%&lt;*!bar&gt;}
      {3}
      {%&lt;/!bar&gt;}
      {4}
      {%&lt;/foo&gt;}
      {5}
      {%&lt;*bar&gt;}
      {6}
      {%&lt;/bar&gt;}
      {end}
   } \n]
   set res [docstrip::extract $text foo]
   append res [docstrip::extract $text {foo bar}]
   append res [docstrip::extract $text bar]
</pre></td></tr></table></p>
sets $res to the result of
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
   join {
      {begin}
      {1}
      {3}
      {4}
      {5}
      {end}
      {begin}
      {1}
      {2}
      {4}
      {5}
      {6}
      {end}
      {begin}
      {5}
      {6}
      {end} &quot;&quot;
   } \n
</pre></td></tr></table></p>

In guard lines without a '*', '/', '+', or '-' modifier after the
'%&lt;', the guard applies only to the CODE following the '&gt;' on that
single line. A '+' modifier is equivalent to no modifier. A '-'
modifier is like the case with no modifier, but the expression is
implicitly negated, i.e., the CODE of a '%&lt;-' guard line is only
included if the expression evaluates to false.
<p>

Metacomment lines are &quot;comment lines which should not be stripped
away&quot;, but be extracted like code lines; these are sometimes used for
copyright notices and similar material. The '%%' prefix is however
not kept, but substituted by the current <strong>-metaprefix</strong>, which
is customarily set to some &quot;comment until end of line&quot; character (or
character sequence) of the language of the code being extracted.
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
   set text [join {
      {begin}
      {%&lt;foo&gt; foo}
      {%&lt;+foo&gt;plusfoo}
      {%&lt;-foo&gt;minusfoo}
      {middle}
      {%% some metacomment}
      {%&lt;*foo&gt;}
      {%%another metacomment}
      {%&lt;/foo&gt;}
      {end}
   } \n]
   set res [docstrip::extract $text foo -metaprefix {# }]
   append res [docstrip::extract $text bar -metaprefix {#}]
</pre></td></tr></table></p>
sets $res to the result of
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
   join {
      {begin}
      { foo}
      {plusfoo}
      {middle}
      {#  some metacomment}
      {# another metacomment}
      {end}
      {begin}
      {minusfoo}
      {middle}
      {# some metacomment}
      {end} &quot;&quot;
   } \n
</pre></td></tr></table></p>

Verbatim guards can be used to force code line
interpretation of a block of lines even if some of them happen to look
like any other type of lines to docstrip. A verbatim guard has the
form '%&lt;&lt;<em>END-TAG</em>' and the verbatim block is terminated by the
first line that is exactly '%<em>END-TAG</em>'.
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
   set text [join {
      {begin}
      {%&lt;*myblock&gt;}
      {some stupid()}
      {   #computer&lt;program&gt;}
      {%&lt;&lt;QQQ-98765}
      {% These three lines are copied verbatim (including percents}
      {%% even if -metaprefix is something different than %%).}
      {%&lt;/myblock&gt;}
      {%QQQ-98765}
      {   using*strange@programming&lt;language&gt;}
      {%&lt;/myblock&gt;}
      {end}
   } \n]
   set res [docstrip::extract $text myblock -metaprefix {# }]
   append res [docstrip::extract $text {}]
</pre></td></tr></table></p>
sets $res to the result of
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
   join {
      {begin}
      {some stupid()}
      {   #computer&lt;program&gt;}
      {% These three lines are copied verbatim (including percents}
      {%% even if -metaprefix is something different than %%).}
      {%&lt;/myblock&gt;}
      {   using*strange@programming&lt;language&gt;}
      {end}
      {begin}
      {end} &quot;&quot;
   } \n
</pre></td></tr></table></p>
The processing of verbatim guards takes place also inside blocks of
lines which due to some outer block guard will not be copied.
<p>

The final piece of <strong>docstrip</strong> syntax is that extraction
stops at a line that is exactly &quot;\endinput&quot;; this is often used to
avoid copying random whitespace at the end of a file. In the unlikely
case that one wants such a code line, one can protect it with a
verbatim guard.


<h2><a name="commands">Commands</a></h2>
<p>

The package defines two commands.

<dl>
<dt><a name="1"><b class='cmd'>docstrip::extract</b> <i class='arg'>text</i> <i class='arg'>terminals</i> ?<i class='arg'>option</i> <i class='arg'>value</i> ...?</a><dd>

  The <b class='cmd'>extract</b> command docstrips the <i class='arg'>text</i> and returns the
  extracted lines of code, as a string with each line terminated with
  a newline. The <i class='arg'>terminals</i> is the list of those guard
  expression terminals which should evaluate to true.
  The available options are:
  <br><br>
<dl>
  <dt><strong>-annotate</strong> <i class='arg'>lines</i><dd>
    Requests the specified number of lines of annotation to follow
    each extracted line in the result. Defaults to 0. Annotation lines
    are mostly useful when the extracted lines are to undergo some
    further transformation. A first annotation line is a list of three
    elements: line type, prefix removed in extraction, and prefix
    inserted in extraction. The line type is one of: 'V' (verbatim),
    'M' (metacomment), '+' (+ or no modifier guard line), '-' (-
    modifier guard line), '.' (normal line). A second annotation line
    is the source line number. A third annotation line is the current
    stack of block guards. Requesting more than three lines of
    annotation is currently not supported.
  <br><br>
<dt><strong>-metaprefix</strong> <i class='arg'>string</i><dd>
    The string by which the '%%' prefix of a metacomment line will
    be replaced. Defaults to '%%'. For Tcl code this would typically
    be '#'.
  <br><br>
<dt><strong>-onerror</strong> <i class='arg'>keyword</i><dd>
    Controls what will be done when a format error in the <i class='arg'>text</i>
    being processed is detected. The settings are:
    <br><br>
<dl>
    <dt><strong>ignore</strong><dd>
      Just ignore the error; continue as if nothing happened.
    <br><br>
<dt><strong>puts</strong><dd>
      Write an error message to <strong>stderr</strong>, then continue
      processing.
    <br><br>
<dt><strong>throw</strong><dd>
      Throw an error. <strong>::errorCode</strong> is set to a list whose
      first element is <strong>DOCSTRIP</strong>, second element is the
      type of error, and third element is the line number where
      the error is detected. This is the default.
    </dl>
  <dt><strong>-trimlines</strong> <i class='arg'>boolean</i><dd>
    Controls whether <em>spaces</em> at the end of a line should be
    trimmed away before the line is processed. Defaults to true.
  </dl>

  It should be remarked that the <i class='arg'>terminals</i> are often called
  &quot;options&quot; in the context of the <strong>docstrip</strong> program, since
  these specify which optional code fragments should be included.


<br><br>
<dt><a name="2"><b class='cmd'>docstrip::sourcefrom</b> <i class='arg'>filename</i> <i class='arg'>terminals</i> ?<i class='arg'>option</i> <i class='arg'>value</i> ...?</a><dd>

  The <b class='cmd'>sourcefrom</b> command is a docstripping emulation of
  <b class='cmd'>source</b>. It opens the file <i class='arg'>filename</i>, reads it, closes it,
  docstrips the contents as specified by the <i class='arg'>terminals</i>, and
  evaluates the result in the local context of the caller, during
  which time the <b class='cmd'>info</b> <strong>script</strong> value will be the
  <i class='arg'>filename</i>. The options are passed on to <b class='cmd'>fconfigure</b> to
  configure the file before its contents are read. The
  <strong>-metaprefix</strong> is set to '#', all other <b class='cmd'>extract</b>
  options have their default values.
</dl>


<h2><a name="document_structure">Document structure</a></h2>
<p>

The file format (as described above) determines whether a master
source code file can be processed correctly by <strong>docstrip</strong>,
but the usefulness of the format is to no little part also dependent
on that the code and comment lines together constitute a well-formed
document.
<p>

For a document format that does not require any non-Tcl software, see
the <b class='cmd'>ddt2man</b> command in the <strong>docstrip::util</strong> package. It
is suggested that files employing that document format are given the
suffix &quot;<strong>.ddt</strong>&quot;, to distinguish them from the more traditional
LaTeX-based &quot;<strong>.dtx</strong>&quot; files.
<p>

Master source files with &quot;<strong>.dtx</strong>&quot; extension are usually set up so
that they can be typeset directly by <strong>latex</strong> without any
support from other files. This is achieved by beginning the file
with the lines
<p><table><tr><td bgcolor=black>&nbsp;</td><td><pre class='sample'>
   % \iffalse
   %&lt;*driver&gt;
   \documentclass{tclldoc}
   \begin{document}
   \DocInput{<em>filename.dtx</em>}
   \end{document}
   %&lt;/driver&gt;
   % \fi
</pre></td></tr></table></p>
or some variation thereof. The trick is that the file gets read twice.
With normal LaTeX reading rules, the first two lines are comments and
therefore ignored. The third line is the document preamble, the fourth
line begins the document body, and the sixth line ends the document,
so LaTeX stops there -- non-comments below that point in the file are
never subjected to the normal LaTeX reading rules. Before that,
however, the \DocInput command on the fifth line is processed, and
that does two things: it changes the interpretation of '%' from
&quot;comment&quot; to &quot;ignored&quot;, and it inputs the file specified in the
argument (which is normally the name of the file the command is in).
It is this second time that the file is being read that the comments
and code in it are typeset.
<p>

The function of the \iffalse ... \fi is to skip lines two to seven
on this second time through; this is similar to the &quot;if 0 { ... }&quot;
idiom for block comments in Tcl code, and it is needed here because
(amongst other things) the \documentclass command may only be
executed once. The function of the &lt;driver&gt; guards is to prevent this
short piece of LaTeX code from being extracted by <strong>docstrip</strong>.
The total effect is that the file can function both as a LaTeX
document and as a <strong>docstrip</strong> master source code file.
<p>

It is not necessary to use the tclldoc document class, but that does
provide a number of features that are convenient for &quot;<strong>.dtx</strong>&quot;
files containing Tcl code. More information on this matter can be
found in the references above.
