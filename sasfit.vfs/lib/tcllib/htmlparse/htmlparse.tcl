# htmlparse::parse --
#
#	This command is the basic parser for HTML. It takes a HTML
#	string, parses it and invokes a command prefix for every tag
#	encountered. It is not necessary for the HTML to be valid for
#	this parser to function. It is the responsibility of the
#	command invoked for every tag to check this. Another
#	responsibility of the invoked command is the handling of tag
#	attributes and character entities (escaped characters). The
#	parser provides the un-interpreted tag attributes to the
#	invoked command to aid in the former, and the package at large
#	provides a helper command, '::htmlparse::mapEscapes', to aid
#	in the handling of the latter. The parser *does* ignore
#	leading DOCTYPE declarations and all valid HTML comments it
#	encounters.
#
#	All information beyond the HTML string itself is specified via
#	options, these are explained below.
#
#	To help understanding the options some more background
#	information about the parser.
#
#	It is capable to detect incomplete tags in the HTML string
#	given to it. Under normal circumstances this will cause the
#	parser to throw an error, but if the option '-incvar' is used
#	to specify a global (or namespace) variable the parser will
#	store the incomplete part of the input into this variable
#	instead. This will aid greatly in the handling of
#	incrementally arriving HTML as the parser will handle whatever
#	he can and defer the handling of the incomplete part until
#	more data has arrived.
#
#	Another feature of the parser are its two possible modes of
#	operation. The normal mode is activated if the option '-queue'
#	is not present on the command line invoking the parser. If it
#	is present the parser will go into the incremental mode instead.
#
#	The main difference is that a parser in normal mode will
#	immediately invoke the command prefix for each tag it
#	encounters. In incremental mode however the parser will
#	generate a number of scripts which invoke the command prefix
#	for groups of tags in the HTML string and then store these
#	scripts in the specified queue. It is then the responsibility
#	of the caller of the parser to ensure the execution of the
#	scripts in the queue.
#
#	Note: The queue objecct given to the parser has to provide the
#	same interface as the queue defined in tcllib -> struct. This
#	does for example mean that all queues created via that part of
#	tcllib can be immediately used here. Still, the queue doesn't
#	have to come from tcllib -> struct as long as the same
#	interface is provided.
#
#	In both modes the parser will return an empty string to the
#	caller.
#
#	To a parser in incremental mode the option '-split' can be
#	given and will specify the size of the groups he creates. In
#	other words, -split 5 means that each of the generated scripts
#	will invoke the command prefix for 5 consecutive tags in the
#	HTML string. A parser in normal mode will ignore this option
#	and its value.
#
#	The option '-vroot' specifies a virtual root tag. A parser in
#	normal mode will invoke the command prefix for it immediately
#	before and after he processes the tags in the HTML, thus
#	simulating that the HTML string is enclosed in a <vroot>
#	</vroot> combination. In incremental mode however the parser
#	is unable to provide the closing virtual root as he never
#	knows when the input is complete. In this case the first
#	script generated by each invocation of the parser will contain
#	an invocation of the command prefix for the virtual root as
#	its first command.
#
#	Interface to the command prefix:
#
#	In normal mode the parser will invoke the command prefix with
#	for arguments appended. See '::htmlparse::debugCallback' for a
#	description. In incremental mode however the generated scripts
#	will invoke the command prefix with five arguments
#	appended. The last four of these are the same which were
#	mentioned above. The first however is a placeholder string
#	(\win\) for a clientdata value to be supplied later during the
#	actual execution of the generated scripts. This could be a tk
#	window path, for example. This allows the user of this package
#	to preprocess HTML strings without commiting them to a
#	specific window, object, whatever during parsing. This
#	connection can be made later. This also means that it is
#	possible to cache preprocessed HTML. Of course, nothing
#	prevents the user of the parser to replace the placeholder
#	with an empty string.
#
# Arguments:
#	args	An option/value-list followed by the string to
#		parse. Available options are:
#
#		-cmd	The command prefix to invoke for every tag in
#			the HTML string. Defaults to
#			'::htmlparse::debugCallback'.
#
#		-vroot	The virtual root tag to add around the HTML in
#			normal mode. In incremental mode it is the
#			first tag in each chunk processed by the
#			parser, but there will be no closing tags.
#			Defaults to 'hmstart'.
#
#		-split	The size of the groups produced by an
#			incremental mode parser. Ignored when in
#			normal mode. Defaults to 10. Values <= 0 are
#			not allowed.
#
#		-incvar	The name of the variable where to store any
#			incomplete HTML into. Optional.
#
#		-queue
#			The handle/name of the queue objecct to store
#			the generated scripts into. Activates
#			incremental mode. Normal mode is used if this
#			option is not present.
#
#		After the option the command explect a single argument
#		containing the HTML string to parse.
#
# Side Effects:
#	In normal mode as of the invoked command. Else none.
#
# Results:
#	None.

#	other words, it accepts four or five arguments. The last four
#	arguments are described below. The optional fifth argument
#	contains the clientdata value given to the callback by a

#	signature of this command in the last four arguments, and
#	callbacks used in incremental parsing have to follow this
#	signature in the last five arguments.

# Arguments:

#				processed by the parser.
#
#	slash			Either empty or a slash. Allows us to
#				distinguish between opening (slash is
#				empty) and closing tags (slash is
#				equal to a '/').
#
#	param			The un-interpreted list of parameters
#				to the tag.

		# a) A tag is now closed but was never opened.
		# b) A tag requiring an end tag was opened but the end
		#    tag was omitted and we now are at a tag which was
		#    opened before the one with the omitted end tag.

		# NOTE:
		# Pages delivered from the amazon.uk site contain both
		# cases: </a> without opening, <b> & <font> without
		# closing. Another error: <a><b></a></b>, i.e. overlapping
		# tags. Fortunately this can be handled by the algorithm
		# below, in two cycles, one of which is case (b), followed
		# by case (a). It seems as if Amazon/UK believes that visual
		# markup like <b> and <font> is an option (switch-on) instead
		# of a region.

		# Algorithm used here to deal with these:
		# 1) Search whole stack for the matching opening tag.
		#    If there is one assume case (b) and pop everything
		#    until and including this opening tag.
		# 2) If no matching opening tag was found assume case
		#    (a) and ignore the tag.
		#
		# Part (1) also subsumes the normal case, i.e. the
		# matching tag is at the top of the stack.

		# (This behaviour of tcllib stacks is not documented
		# -> we should update the manpage).
