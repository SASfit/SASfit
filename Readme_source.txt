SASfit libraries
----------------

Software source code package of model functions and other libraries 
used by SASfit, a program for fitting small-angle scattering curves

It consists of the following modules:
f2c             (Copyright by AT&T Bell Laboratories and Bellcore, 
                 see src/f2c/copyright)
sasfit-common   (Utilities, functions and datastructures used by all modules)
sasfit-sd       ((size-) distributions)
sasfit-sq       (structure factors)
sasfit-peaks    (peaks)
sasfit-ff       (form factors)
sasfit-core     (core functionality of the sasfit program, 
                 not complete, in progress)

Requirements: 
- Cmake >=2.8.0 (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
- GSL library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)
              (for Windows: http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/gsl.htm)
- Tcl >=8.4 for sasfit-core
