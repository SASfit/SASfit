 * \ingroup peaks
 *
 * The normal distribution, also called the Gaussian distribution, 
 * is an important family of continuous probability distributions, 
 * applicable in many fields. Each member of the family may be defined 
 * by two parameters, location and scale: the mean ("average", \f$x_c\f$) 
 * and variance (standard deviation squared, \f$\sigma^2\f$) respectively.

/**
 * \defgroup gamma Gamma
 * \ingroup peaks
 *
 * In probability theory and statistics, the gamma distribution is a 
 * two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions. 
 * It has a scale parameter \f$\theta\f$ and a shape parameter \f$k\f$. 
 * If \f$k\f$ is an integer then the distribution represents the sum of 
 * \f$k\f$ independent exponentially distributed random variables, each 
 * of which has a mean of \f$\theta\f$ (which is equivalent to a rate 
 * parameter of \f$\theta^{-1}\f$) .
