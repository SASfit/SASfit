 *
 * \brief In this library distribution functions \f$n(x)\f$ are collected.
 * A size distribution describes the number of particles in a sample according
 * to their size.
 * These function are used to describe the distribution of a parameter
 * \f$a_i\f$ of a form factor \f$P(Q,\{a_i\})\f$.
 * \f[
 *              I(Q) = \int_0^\infty n(a_j)\, P\left(Q,\{\dots, a_j, \dots\}\right) \, da_j
 * \f]
