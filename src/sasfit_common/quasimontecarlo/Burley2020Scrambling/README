This supplemental material contains implementations of various point sequences described in
Practical Hash-based Owen Scrambling, Burley 2020

There is both a command-line point generator (genpoints) and a PyQt5 visualizer (viewpoints.py).

The sequences supported are:

random       - using PCG32
sobol        - Sobol' sequence, up to 5 dimensions
sobol_rds    - Sobol' w/ random digit scrambling
sobol_owen   - Sobol' w/ Owen scrambling and shuffling
laine_karras - 1D radical-inverse sequence shuffled with Laine-Karras hash
faure_05     - (0,5) sequence from Faure 1982

In the visualizer, there is an additional sequence listed, sobol_owen_decorrelated.
In that sequence, a different seed is used from the v dimension which results in a
different shuffling which decorrelates the u and v axes.

The FFT uses code provided by Andrew Kensler.

To build, use make.
