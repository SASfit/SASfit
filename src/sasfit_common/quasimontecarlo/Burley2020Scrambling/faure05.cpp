#include "faure05.h"

/*
 (0,5) sequence from Faure 1982.
 The generator in each dimension i is the upper-triangular Pascal Matrix raised to power i (mod 5).
 The formula is from Faure 2001, Variations on (0,s)-Sequences, Section 3.1.

 In Mathematica:
 Table[If[j == r, 1,
       If[j > r, 0,
       Mod[Binomial[r, j] i^(r - j), 5]]],
       {i, 0, 4}, {j, 0, 12}, {r, 0, 12}] */
