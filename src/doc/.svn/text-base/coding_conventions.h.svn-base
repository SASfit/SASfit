/**
 * \page coding_conv \sf Coding Conventions
 * \brief Guidelines for programming style concerning \sf.
 *
 * Please follow these guidelines when adding new code to \sf either to the 
 * core program or as a plugin. This decreases the required effort for
 * maintaining existing code and increases readability. Last but not least it
 * improves the portability to future requirements.
 *
 * Following articles illustrate the idea: \n
 * http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coding_conventions (english) \n
 * http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmierstil (german) \n
 *
 * For an extensive reference on this topic see also the
 * <em>GNU coding standards</em>, especially: \n
 * http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/standards.html#Writing-C
 *
 * <b>Some rough key points:</b>
 * - usage of standard C for portability \n
 *   (no traditional or pre-standard C)
 * - variable and function names are always in lower case
 * - Defines (<tt>\#define</tt>) are always in upper case
 * - indents (white space) at the beginning of a line are always tabs
 *   (&quot;tabulator&quot;: \\t)\n
 *   (good text editors can be configured to display tabs with less than 
 *   eight spaces if the lines are too long/wide)
 *
 * \note
 * Most parts of \sf written or rewritten since March 2008 follow these
 * conventions. Nevertheless, there are still some parts which are 
 * non-conformant. This is not desired and will be fixed in future
 * development.
