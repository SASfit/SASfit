 * The documentation is provided inline for extraction with the \e doxygen
 * program. Basically, it is a command line tool which works according to a
 * supplied configuration file on the command line. This configuration file
 * comes with the \sf source package and there is no further configuration
 * required.
 *
 * \section run_dox Run Doxygen
 *
 * To generate the \sf documentation, open a command prompt (on Windows)
 * or a terminal window (on Linux) and type the following:
 *
 * \code
 * cd <your-sasfit_source-directory>
 * cd src
 * doxygen Doxyfile
 * \endcode
 *
 * The doxygen command outputs a lot of status messages while it parses the
 * source code. Per default, the generated HTML documentation resides in
 * <tt>\sf_src/doc/html/</tt>.
 * To view and read it, open the index.html file with your Webbrowser.
 * (<tt>\sf_src/doc/html/index.html</tt>)
 *
 * To generate the \sf documentation in a different output format than HTML
 * you have to edit the Doxyfile. The relevant statements look like 
 * <tt>GENERATE_<format></tt>. Doxygen supports formats like LaTex, RTF, 
 * Unix Manpages, XML and others, see the doxygen website for details.
