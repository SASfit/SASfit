 * \section abstract Abstract
 *
 * \b \sf has been written for analyzing and plotting small angle
 * scattering data. It can calculate integral structural parameters
 * like radius of gyration, scattering invariant, Porod constant.
 * Furthermore it can fit size distributions together with several form
 * factors including different structure factors. Additionally an
 * algorithm has been implemented, which allows to simultaneously fit
 * several scattering curves with a common set of (global) parameters.
 * This last option is especially important in contrast variation
 * experiments or measurements with polarised neutrons. The global fit
 * helps to determine fit parameters unambiguously which by analyzing a
 * single curve would be otherwise strongly correlated. The program has
 * been written to fulfill the needs at the small angle neutron
 * scattering facility at PSI ( http://kur.web.psi.ch ). The
 * numerical routines have been written in C whereas the menu interface
 * has been written in Tcl/Tk and the plotting routine with the
 * extension BLT. 
 *
 * The latest stable \b \sf version can be downloaded
 * from http://kur.web.psi.ch/sans1/SANSSoft/sasfit.html.
